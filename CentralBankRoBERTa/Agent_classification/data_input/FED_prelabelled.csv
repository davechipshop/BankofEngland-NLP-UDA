between the second quarter of 1984 and the end of 1986 money as measured by ml accelerated to a growth rate of close to 18 percent,4
and the euro will encourage an increase in both the issuance of eurodenominated liabilities as well as in the demand for eurodenominated assets,2
the reasoning here suggests that a rapid rise in asset prices accompanied by a credit boom provides a signal that should lead central bankers and other financial supervisors to carefully scrutinize financial developments to see if market failures might be driving the asset price boom,2
if we persist in pursuing 2 percent and show confidence in our capabilities price setters will follow,4
thus consumer spending should remain fairly healthyeven at     3 moderate rates of income growth,0
community development is no  accident nor can there be economic growth without it,0
the natural next question is has the ccar qualitative objection for the largest firms also run its course,2

montanas actual population during the 30year  period increased from 539000 to 674000 a gain of 25 per cent but the states population had it not been for outmigration would have been 784000 the report estimated outmigration from the state during the 30year period at 97000 the upper midwest is predominantly urban for the first time in its history,0
some of  you may wonder whether our elected officials faced with the truly monumental  task of balancing the nations books might simply throw in the towel and turn  to the fed to print us out of this enormous fiscal hole,3
indeed relative to gnp the volume of such credit appears to have returned to the record pace of 1978even after allowance for mergerrelated financings,2
but the common  interest between savings bankers and central bankers is closer,2
i look forward to working with you to make the financial system safer and stronger,2
twenty years ago the chicago fed had nearly 3000 employees today we have almost 1800 much of the recent reduction was in staff working to process paper checks and it has been the direct result of new payments technologies,0
because the fed appears to an increasing degree to be following a policy of what i have called constrained discretion one must ask is this policy approach consistent with the congresss mandate for monetary policy,3
that is we cannot forecast what our business practices and products will look like only a decade aheadover a period of time say in which your careers will have just begun,1

i assure you that our longterm goal subject to the will of congress is to move to broader powers to assure the competitive position of united states banks both domestically and internationally,2
in many industries demand looks strong and capacity utilization is high,1
if these other factors are inflating the economy monetary policy should be deflationary and vice versaa third view is that monetary policy has a special obligation to defend the value of the dollar both at home and abroad,4
but the key point is that we see no great economic pressures that would force small banks to sell or fail,2
the rising tide created by economic growth does not necessarily lift all boats though it certainly helps most,0
large money center banks are casting a keen eye on their sources and uses of funding,2
in such a case in which the firms capital is negative the ownership of the bankrupt firm should be changedunless the owners succeed in mobilizing more capital in which case the company was probably not bankrupt,1
2  i would argue that we have now entered a third phase in the process of coping with the debt problem,3
the banks you serve are better able to reach new customers especially groups of customers who have historically been underbanked when they show that serving those customers is a top priority,0
counterparties that cannot obtain sufficient information should limit more strictly the amount of credit they supply through for example requiring higher margins,2
about a third of the surveyed firms in the district said they planned to share some of their tax savings with employees in the form of increased wages bonuses or additions to employee pension plans,0
without some kind of common understanding of what is necessary for adequate care or else some change in the way health care is financed the united states can only continue to spend an everincreasing percentage of gdp with no useful means to rein in the spending,3
there is really nothing new about the concern of monetary policy with the monetary aggregates,4
the primary responsibility for reassessing and strengthening the management of liquidity risk appropriately rests with market participants themselves but prudential supervisors working with central banks should carefully review the practices of regulated entities,2
a widely noted feature of this legislative effort is the fairly  broad scope for regulatory discretion,2
i  virtual el imination of balan ce of payments deficits,3
moreover the knowledge gained through  banking supervision aids the formation of monetary policy,2
it also means designing exit strategies that will allow us to end these lending programs and drain that liquidity in a timely manner,2
since early october financial conditions in the us have tightened,2
industries such as leisure and hospitality food  services and retail trade have high turnover rates11 theres also a question  about the longterm stability of these jobs as automation may displace many  lowskill workers in the coming decades,0
and a downturn in commercial real estate would of course affect the financial industry  et cetera et cetera,2
at that time there was a banking office for every 3700 people and banking was enjoying a golden age of prestige and affluence,2
once an organization qualifies it can engage in a widerange of new activ ities for example underwriting of insurance debt and equity financing and a full line of investment products,2
this same type of paradox faces black entrepreneurs in their search for qualified labor,1
thats why i urge you as industry leaders to keep pushing the analytics further both to improve the discipline and to assure regulators that you know how to run an internal risk based system,2
in short losers from inflation tend increasingly to be protected while those who profitexcept for taxationkeep their gainsthe result must necessarily be a more inflationary outcome for the economy as a wholefrom what i have said it must be evident that i believe inflation has become our majo,3
one way we are doing our part is by actively promoting economic education and financial literacy in our schools,0
we are concerned today as we have never been before in the history of this country with international relations,3
for example one of the researchers at the chicago fed in collaboration with other economists used unemployment records from pennsylvania to examine the earnings of workers before and after they were laid off,0
these  measures are comprised for the most part of provisions which were included in last years financial institutions bill,2
manipulating government spending tends     to be a rather clumsy way of dealing with rapidly changing economic developments while the process of reaching a consensus on needed tax changes usually turns out to be complex and time consuming,3
these developments have important implications for our benchmarks for the monthly employment statistics,0
those risks materialize when a clearing member defaults,2
but in doing so we must remember that the major advances in technologically sophisticated financial products in recent years have imparted a discipline on market participants excluding a few glaring exceptions not seen in nearly a century,2
this is where a sound risk management and internal control framework can be very helpful,2
thus i want to take this opportunity to emphasize and reinforce the case for central bank involvement in bank supervision made by chairman bernanke in a speech last month,2
standard macroeconomics  began with the notion that we could not explain unemployment with classical equilibrium models  in a nonstochastic frictionless classical model where agents optimize and  markets clear monetary policy is neutral,4
for a time those actions seemed to be reducing the pressures in term funding markets,2
however fiscal policy as measured by the annual federal budget deficit became more and more unbalanced,3
when cra was enacted the concern was that lowerincome communities did not have access to capital and financial services,0
the government estimates payroll employmentthe number of jobsfrom a survey of businessesthe establishment survey,0
it should be noted that all of these developments are by no means fully integrated as yet into banking or the broaderfinancial system but   6 rather are gradually becoming assimilated and so the full impact of these changes has perhaps still to be feltforces shaping bankingit seems to me that the basic causal factors reshaping the banking industry have been and will for the foreseeable future continue to be customer demand and bank management response thereto,2

our local presence gives us valuable opportunities to engage with communities across a broad spectrumfrom those who are thriving to those who are confronting challenges and from innercity neighborhoods to rural towns,0
the capital maintenance concept appropriate for bank accounting and reporting is financial capital in units of money,2
to ensure that banks use the facility only as a backup source of funds federal reserve loans are made at an abovemarket rate,2
the maturity profile of bank assets should be matched against the maturity profile of bank liabilities and should be reported in a manner and frequency which reveals the gross exposure to disintermediation,2
rebuilding can have a positive impact on the local economy  with increased construction and business activity,0
this focus of course is the essence of community bankingit is obviously impossible to predict with certainty the future course of banking consolidation and what that course may imply for your banks,2
workers are using their own laptops and smart phones or working remotely from home computers and this increases the entry points to the systems that need to be protected,0
as is well understood the existence of emergency credit facilities for financial market utilities could give rise to moral hazard for example in the form of insufficient attention by clearinghouses to establishment of privatesector liquidity arrangements in advance of a crisis,2
rural america and its relationship to the broader economy has changed enormously over time,0
increased defense spending during the 1980s contributed to the booms in places like massachusetts and southern california,3
finally it can be argued that much of the uncertainty has to be dealt with in other areas of government and monetary policy cant do much about this kind of problem,3
to achieve this the fed must make two important contributions to the economy,4
in the short run stock market fluctuations are far far larger than fluctuations in the nations production which we measure by the inflationadjusted gross domestic product gdp,2
it may make this difficult undertaking somewhat less intimidating if we remember that all balancing effotts of the type i have suggested cannot hope to be perfec the firancial and social inequities vhich i have described can i believe be reduced but in this prolonged struggle with inflcjtionary forces we cannot expect to be so skillful or so fortunate as to be able to avoid them entirely,0
not only do changes in tax rates and spending affect aggregate demand they can also affect  aggregate supply for example when they alter aftertax wage rates and aftertax rates of return to saving and investment,3
importantly the 64 metric used to size the appropriate capital buffer does not represent a new capital standard and is not expected necessarily to be maintained on an ongoing basis,2
to be sure adverse consequences for resource allocation and perhaps even for the stability of output and prices will occur if private agents overestimate the ability or willingness of central banks to damp volatility in asset prices or the economy,2
whatever the specific approaches chosen helping workers who have lost jobswhether because of trade or other causesto find new productive work is good for the economy as well as for the affected workers and their families,0
by prepositioning lossabsorbing resources in life and planning for an orderly resolution in the event of failure we can provide the policymakers who come after us with more options than they had in the great financial crisis if they are faced with future systemic financial stress,2
this years inflation in turn will add more fuel to the wageprice spiral which got underway in the late 1960s and which was not eradicated during the 196970 recession,0
during 1992 the region added nearly 300000 new jobs,0
the asymmetry in risk management stems from the combination of the likely low current level of the neutral real interest rate and the effective lower bound,2
with these reforms in place we can give banks expanded powers to compete headon with nonbanks and international competitors and banks can remain viable players in this increasingly competitive industry,2
wholesale and retail trade are not subject to the valueadded tax but are subject to a local turnover tax thus the french indirect tax system at present is a combination of a turnover tax and a valueadded tax,3
it was not only capital spending and equity prices that seemed to overshoot in the late 1990s credit was provided with undue optimism about prospects for repayment,2
greater price transparency facilitated by the internet may have increased consumer price elasticity and thereby dampened the responsiveness of inflation to resource pressures,0
in several states the unemployment rate is higher than the national average,0
equally important their emergence from isolation may mean that the world can begin spending less o f its energy and resources arming for war and more on raising living standards,0
grow we must if we are to have more jobs and higher living standards,0
the blue chip consensus expects monthly nonfarm payroll employment gains to average a little less than 170000 in 2004 similarly the recent outlook survey by the national association for business economics projects that monthly job gains will average 150000 per month in 2004 these projected rates of job creation are well below those seen during the 1980s business expansion when payroll employment increases averaged about 230000 per month and during the 1990s expansion when payroll employment increases averaged roughly 200000 per month,0
a large and rapidly growing labor force and low  education levels however have meant that border wages have remained low  relative to the national average,0
the cea chairman also stated that a real growth rate of 4 per cent should be sufficient to prevent the overall unemployment rate from rising above the interim target of 4 per cent,0
from 1965 to 1970 when the economic stimulus from the vietnam war was heaped on an economy already operating at high capacity rates consumer price increases went from l½ to nearly 6 percent but then subsided to 3½ percent by 1972 even that was considered disturbing and for a time we resorted to the crutch of wage and price controls,0
the dpartment of labor reported last week that major union contract agreements reached during the first nine months of this year provided for firstyear wage increases of just 38 percent excluding possible cola increases,0
the unemployment rate has risen by a half percentage point since march and now stands at 49 percent,0
the flexibility of our industry and workforce to reinvent themselves when the need arises forms the basis for increasing standards of living,0
elimination of excess den1and was an essential first step to the restoration of stability but this step has broght with it a period of sluggish economic activity slow income growth and rising unemployment,0
in collective bargaining situations it may be that management has learned to involve labor more in locating new plants and expansion of existing ones as well as the considerations which go into the downward adjustments of their productive capacity ünion leadership in industries under the pressure of very low capacity or deregulation have gone beyond concessions in wages and benefits and agreed to changes in work rules and other prerogatives lying outside compensationi believe that monetary policy has contributed to the reduction of inflation and even of inflationary expectations to sane degree,0
union leadership in industries under the pressure of very low capc1ci ty or deregulation have gone beyond concessions in wages and benefits and cigreed to changes in work rules and other prerogatives lying outside canpensation,0
here are examples of what i would look for first i would look for lower unemployment rates that are driven by increased flows of job seekers into employment,0
the shift from rapid to slower labor force growth will have important and lasting effects on the economy,0
both of these countries had surpassed prewar levels of industrial output by the end of 1952another significant difference is the higher rate of expansion of the labor force in germany and japan,0
the growth in the labor force is slowing reducing the potential growth rate of gdp,0
wages in major union contracts agreed to last year were down3 indicators of international econanic developments eg exchange rates,0
after all a lower value of the dollar is likely to raise the cost of imports which can feed into higher consumer prices,0
notably according to the professionals   even this performance is not expected to decrease the unemployment rate   by very much,0
in fact since january i have not changed my growth forecast for 2010 or 2011 i expect the recovery to gain traction in 2010 with growth picking up to about 3 percent and then settling down to its longrun steady state of about 27 percent in 2011 the sharp rise in the unemployment rate in the first few months of 2009 and the steep declines in payroll employment have led me to revise upward my unemployment rate forecasts,0
i am not aware of solid analysis suggesting that 2 percent growth would produce a perceptible reduction in unemployment rateshie index of leading economic indicators also presents a mixed picture of the future,0
employment growth last year averaged a solid 220000 per month and the unemployment rate declined from 56 percent to 50 percent over the course of 2015 inflation ran well below our target last year held down by the transitory effects of declines in crude oil prices and also in the prices of nonoil imports,0
the concerns of these countries are legitimate but they should be balanced by an awareness of the costs and dangers of continued high unemployment and continued international imbalances,0
in an increasingly free trade environment europe and japan have been rebuilt america has enjoyed rising living standards and the ldcs  despite some recent setbacks  have built some foundation for sustained economic growth but only providing the environment for free and fair trade is maintained and enhanced,0
housing has not responded as much as was expected to the decline in mortgage interest rates  in part because of an offsetting tightening of credit standards by fnma mortgage lenders and mortgage insurers,0
construction of singlefamily houses has already been rising for more than a year in the wake of lower mortgage interest rates and the gradual absorption of the large inventories of homes built in the 1980s,0
if the market foresees a lower mortgage rate in the future then the current treasury bond yield will be correspondingly low relative to the current yield on mortgagebacked securities,0
there have been some times of relative prosperity when income has grown for most households but inequality widened because the gains were proportionally larger for those at the top widening inequality might not be as great a concern if living standards improve for most families,0
proposed restraints often are intended to protect consumers from their own poor judgment which makes them vulnerable to abusive lending practices,0
and going forward the recent strong gains in employment and income should continue to support healthy gains in consumption,0
most of us are happy that it has been  possible to raise the social security benefits to retired workers,0
restructuring and participation   as the number of puzzles concerning the labor market increases so does the complexity of analysis necessary to relate observed variables to concepts relevant for monetary policy,0
the degree of slack in labor markets does have some effect on the rise of wages but it takes a painfully long time to workin todays economy any fresh impetus to inflationwhether it comes from rising opec prices a food shortage a productivity disaster or a mistake in economic policytends to worsen the longterm trend of inflation,0
even making allowances for the sharp runup in oil prices and the impact of increases in homeownership cost the rate of rise in the consumer price index was tending to accelerate,0
over those two years consumer prices rose by more than twenty per centthe first experience for our nation at least in modern times with double digit inflation,0
in the past 10 years during a period when population increased by 19 the  labor force has increased 26,0
given the weak growth in employment so far this year we have not made even the modest progress on reducing unemployment rates that many forecasters had anticipated,0
moreover increases in food prices and in the prices of some imported goods have the potential to put additional pressures on inflation and inflation expectations,0
inventorysales ratios in real terms have declined to levels that are lower than at any time during the past five years and this might lead to significant further increases in inventory investment during 1984 the housing market seems to have shaken off the effects of the earlier rise in interest rates sales of new homes increased from september through november and housing starts and permits also recovered late last year,0
the feds success keeping inflation low helped provide the foundation for the strong economy and low unemployment rates weve experienced in recent years,0
it reduces the level of compensation built into longterm interest rates to make up for the loss of purchasing power due to inflation,0
that high unemployment rate is why the federal reserve is focusing its monetary policy at strengthening the recovery and job creation including keeping shortterm interest rates near zero and longerterm rates such as mortgage rates at the lowest levels in decades,0
perhaps just as importantly inflation and inflation expectations have become more stable since then as welldeclining inflation does not appear to have come at the cost of slower growth or high unemployment,0
in the meantime employment will continue to grow in health services delivery,0
the left fork is a continuation of the status quo or worse a rollback of insurance and securities powers for the banks which have not only been prudently managed but have resulted in better service to corporations and greater convenience and lower prices to consumers,0
a third purpose is to provide data to assist in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and facilitate the enforcement of antidiscrimination laws such as the equal credit opportunity act,0
historically the hmda reports have focused on the geographic distribution of home loans both home purchase and home improvement,0
they also raise questions about the performance of lenders in meeting their obligations under the community reinvestment act crai can assure you of the federal reserves longstanding concern about these issues and strong commitment to enforcing compliance with fair lending laws,0
that topic is discrimination in mortgage lendingor more specifically as your program notes detecting discrimination in mortgage lending,0
w e initiated these forums in order to exchange ideas about h o w to foster economic development and equal access to credit in low and moderate income areas,0
over the course of the recovery by contrast the labor force has grown by an average of about 05 percent,0
business policies labor contract bargaining and government programs are all set in terms of augmenting money income to maintain purchasing power rather than attempting to achieve similar results in real terms by reducing costs and henceprice pressures,0
the very rapid increase in mortgage interest rates in recent months has resulted in a precipitous drop in new housing starts in march starts of single family houses were close to a record low for the postwar period,0
reflecting these changes t black unemployment rate rose further from 92 per cent in the last quarter of 1970 to 101 per cent in the final quarter of 1971 over the same period the white rate remained unchanged at 54 per cent,0
in countries that experienced a postworld war ii baby boom large increases in the labor force in the 1960s and 1970s reduced the dependency ratio and enabled increasingly generous transfer payments to retired persons,0
in part core inflation has been elevated because businesses have raised their prices in response to earlier increases in energy costs,0
and if workers expect high inflation they will ask for  higher wage increases,0
the lower trend of nominal wage increases over the past two years has because of the drop in inflation been consistent with higher real wages,0
structural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longerrun growth of output and increases in living standards,0
on the part of lenders and borrowers it leads to interest rates demanded and paid that reflect the lenders fear of losing purchasing power and the borrowers hope that inflation will convert nominally high into really low rates,0
most observers including myself judge this level of unemployment to be much higher than levels consistent with full employment and stable inflation,0
as you may recall we ended up with both high unemployment and high inflation and the sum of those two statistics became known as the misery index,0
for the long run there is no choice but that of a policy that can sustain both high employment and stable prices,0
because this expansion is solidly grounded in improving fundamentals i expect robust growth in consumer spending to persist as households see continuing improvements in job markets incomes and wealth,0
2 we were then most concerned with the high rate of unemployment that had persisted even during cyclical upturns,0
rising labor force utilization rates raise wage change relative to productivity growth,0
this suggests at least the possibility that we may be moving into a new era of decelerating inflation with the electorate insisting on bringing under control the largescale deficit financing and the ac companying overlyrapid monetary expansion during periods of high employment,0
economic theory suggests that energy price hikes of this magnitude should have an important contractionary effect on the economy by reducing the purchasing power of households and holding down business profits outside the energy sector,0
budget savings lets then take a policy change that raises the retirement age three months every two years or 125 years every decade and taxes all wages for both social security and medicare,0
based on the latest revision firms added an average of 194000 jobs per month in 2013 which is a somewhat better pace than in 2012 this consistent pace of job growth was enough to drop the unemployment rate to 66 percent in january,0
during the first year of recovery the unemployment rate fell an average of 14 percentage points,0
for individuals better education is correlated with lower levels of unemployment and higher wages,0
although the persistent high level of unemployment will tend to restrain inflation further the effect of resource slack on inflation does not appear to be as great as some previous episodes might have led us to expect,0
unemployment has dropped                            to 47 percent the lowest rate in four years,0
give the fed a clear mandate to preserve the purchasing power of the dollar and maintain its independence to do so and much of the current uncertainty about policy would melt away,0
now it is true that when i graduated the slack job market put  downward pressure on all wages including those of college grads,0
the monthly print corresponds to an annualized rate exceeding 10 percent while the yearoveryear increase was 62 percentâU0080U0094the highest since december 1990 despite the highest wage gains in years inflation this year has wiped out any real wage increase for the average worker,0
but now some combination of good luck and good policy has brought us an eight year run of strong growth declining unemployment and falling inflation and made the american economy a vital positive force in a turbulent world,0
we have real incomes rising which shouldnt be so unusual but two consecutive years of an increase in real income is unusual in terms of our economic performance in the i 970s vhich is a reflection of how dismal they really were,0
their costs meanwhile have continued to soar with increasing wage rates and sharply rising prices of materials,0
in its place arose the view that          government action was required to restore full employment,0
while unemployment remains high the overall demand for workers is gradually improving,0
inflation is simply a process involving erosion of the purchasing power of a nations money supply   that is simply a deterioration in the exchange rate between money and goods and services,0
americans have come to expect a continually rising standard of living,0
inflation erodes the purchasing power of wages,0
several daily and weekly retail spending indicators tracked by federal reserve board staff suggest that household spending increased quickly in response to stimulus payments and expanded unemployment insurance benefits,0
we need to ask for example whether we should be concerned with the degree of income inequality if all groups are experiencing relatively rapid gains in their real incomes though those rates of gain may differ,0
in the united kingdom the government has recently reached an agreement with trade union leaders to grant tax reductions in return for holding wage increases to an average of about 412 per cent during the year beginning on august 1 such a policy would involve some decline in real income for workers in the united kingdom,0
lets increase the minimum wage lets increase price  supports for farmers lets restrict imports lets do this and that and the other thing,0
job levels are still not back to their prerecession highs and the states unemployment rate has been higher than the nations,0
my own prediction is that unemployment will remain above 8  percent into 2012 persistently high unemployment of this kind will impose  considerable losses on many of our citizens,0
both employment with 612 million new jobs created over the past two years and average real incomes have gained,0
in that context the average worker should be able to see his real income increase something that hasnt happened for five years or so,0
overall our evolving economic and financial systems have been highly successful in promoting growth and higher standards of living for the majority of our citizens,0
inflation redjces real incomes and va1je it tnreaten ojr ability to provide employment opportjnities it dries up job creating investmnts it impedes prodjctivity it breed recession it falls most neavily on those least able to bear tne bjrden,0
since the survey began in its current form in 1989 the scf has shown a rise in the concentration of income in the top few percent of households as shown in figure 16 by definition of course the share of all income held by the rest the vast majority of households has fallen by the same amount7 this concentration was the result of income and living standards rising much more quickly for those at the top,0
such a price spike effectively represented a tax that drained purchasing power from oil consumers,0
exhibit 2 the birthrate of the postworld w a r ii babyboom generation reached its highest levels in the period 1957 through 1962 individuals b o m in those years reached working age between 1977 and 1982 indeed the labor force grew sharply throughout the 1980s because of the baby boom,0
the two that are both current and perennial may be stated a b o u t as follows a monetary policy like broad economic policy claims to be concerned with economic growth high employment and price stability,0
first i expect upward pressure on wages from the prevailing tightness in the labor market,0
along with somewhat higher mortgage rates the inventory of unsold new singlefamily homes has increased steadily to nearly six months at current sales rates,0
further more we are confident that all of this can be accomplished while continuing to protect the public interest  our ultimate goal,0
in sum once we get through the nearterm weakness caused by the extra downleg from the housing contraction and any spillover from tighter credit conditions i am looking for moderate growth with high levels of employment,0
indeed if wages are much stickier than prices the best strategy is to stabilize nominal wage inflation rather than price inflation thereby allowing price inflation to decline to achieve the required increase in real wages,0
consumer prices have risen more for assistance in the preparation of this paper i am indebted to mr christopher taylor and ms merphil kondo of the boards staff,0
in past periods of high unemployment much of the burden was carried by heads of families fulltime workers whose loss of employment was a serious hardship for adults and their children as well,0
labor market conditions continue to be very strong with abovetrend job growth and very low unemployment,0
response of unemployment and prices to declines in economic growth some of the analytical work i have done suggests that a significant impact on the pace of inflation can be achieved only if we are prepared to see the economy run well below capacity including a somewhat higher level of unemployment for quite some time,0
this is translating into very small increases in wages and salaries as measured by the employment cost index they rose just 112 percent for the past year  the lowest recorded increase since the series began in 1983 consequently we are not seeing any upward pressure on prices coming from labor costs,0
standards of living rise because the depreciation and other cash flows of industries employing older increasingly obsolescent technologies are marshaled along with new savings to finance the production of capital assets that almost always embody cuttingedge technologies,0
ever since the korean  war american families have experienced an increase in the purchasing power of their paychecks,0
four percent cuts exactly in half the purchasing power of the dollar in 18 years which means that the parents of a baby born today has to save exactly twice as much in order to pay for a years college as they would if there was a stable purchasing power of the currency,0
in still shorter words it is to provide more jobs and more goods combined with a dollar of stable buying power which implies that there can be no economic equilibrium unless the dollar is stable,0
low and stable inflation together with  a steady peso has protected the purchasing power of the mexican consumer and  allowed nest eggs to grow,0
i have defined its goal as follows to foster orderly economic growth and to sustain employment at consistently high levels,0
i do not accept the analyses which point to the food price increases the petroleum product price increases or other special factors as causes of the underlying inflationary trend,0
since 1965 when inflation has been most intense overall consumer prices have risen at an average 44 percent annual rate while the cost of home ownership has risen at a 67 percent pace,0
one approach was to argue that since taxpayers would have 13 billion less purchasing power as a result of the tax increase and the federal government would spend 6 billion less than otherwise a total of 19 billion would be taken out of the spending stream,0
at best it is a shortterm fix at a cost of lower standards of living for the nation as a whole,0
the feds ultimate goal is maximum sustainable growth and a higher standard of living for everyone over the long term,0
in this way stability of purchasing power helps us to profit from past experience and to plan our future actions,0
for example in 1958 in the manufacturing sector only 7 per cent of the total employment was in firms with fewer than 20 employees while over threefifths were employed in firms with more than 500 employees,0
9 source equal employment opportunity commission,0
as the overall economic expansion accelerated during 1961 and 1962 white workers found increased employment opportunities at a rapid pace but it was only after a substantial lag that nonwhites had an opportunity to share in the gains,0
while it is difficult to know with precision how much slack still remains i am seeing more evidence that labor markets are tightening and wages are accelerating although at a measured pace,0
the official unemployment rate has more than doubled from 32 percent in december to 66 percent in june,0
2 the  discussion in this paragraph is largely consistent with the following quote  from chairman bernankes response to a reporters question in april about the  feds ability to lower the rate of unemployment more rapidly even purely from  an employment perspectivethat if inflation were to become unmoored inflation  expectations were to rise significantly that the cost of that in terms of  employment loss in the future as we had to respond to that would be quite  significant see transcript of  chairman bernankes april 27 2011 press conference p,0
employment in aerospace and related industries dropped by 2 per cent or more but californias total employment in that period increased at least 3 per cent and total personal income rose at least 5 per cent,0
todays tight labor market presents a great chance to connect more people to jobs including people who might have had difficulty finding employment in the past,0
mining and oil personal  2      one of the big increases was in personal income from government federal state and local  from 89 per cent to 138 per cent,0
on the other hand i am personally convinced that blacks would do well to look more to the private sectorand less to public payrollsfor expanded job opportunities in the years ahead,0
personal income growth has been relatively slow in comparison to consumer spending and debt ratios look high from some standpoints,0
after a good deal of debate and another six years the congress embodied this right with reference to the cost of credit in the consumer credit protection act,0
in particular bringing overall inflation immediately back to the low rate consistent with price stability could be associated with a much higher rate of unemployment for a short time,0
therefore workers will continue to find jobs in the expanding service and trade areas so that the regions total employment should increase by about half a million new jobs in 1987 constructionthe other populationdriven economic sectorwill not however do as well as one might expect given the anticipated amount of population expansion,0
the combination of rising employment and rising wage gains has supported substantial income growth  over the last four months for which we have data real personal income has risen at a healthy 54 percent annual rate,0
although the pace of payroll gains has moderated recently unemployment is at a 50year low wages are growing participation in the labor force has expanded and unemployment insurance claims are at cycle lows,0
according to the household survey the labor force participation rate has actually declined significantly since the official trough of the cycle from 667 percent of the workingage population in november 2001 to 659 percent in march 20044 from its peak last june the unemployment rate has fallen by 06 percentage point from 63 percent to 57 percent,0
in may the unemployment rate increased for the fifth consecutive month and reached 5 per cent of the civilian labor force,0
so it is likely that the natural unemployment rate is lower than it was in the early 1990s,0
with the rising level of personal income there has been an increase  in the demand for trust services and the trend will continue,0
during the recession and immediately after the losses in wealth may have put upward pressure on labor force participation the persistently weak labor market may have subsequently contributed to more retirements and thus put downward pressure on participation,0
the benefits will accrue  expanding industries in the  export field will also increase job opportunities in your state,0
we see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective,0
dangers can also arise of course whenever there are efforts to circumvent regulatory actions taken to promote the public interest,0
so we promote public confidence in this system and improve its efficiency through bank super v ision and by our active involvement in the operation of our nations payments system,0
the productivity increases of the past have brought us  our present high standard of living and further increases are necessary for providing us with the supplies we need today at stable prices,0
the increase has substantially pushed up homeowners mortgage payments in relation to their income in spite of historically low mortgage rates the growing use of interestonly mortgages and the lengthening of average loan maturities over the past few years,0
while the unemployment rate is lower than the level that is sustainable in the longer run inflation is near 2 percent and does not show signs of appreciably rising,0
i dont find the nairu concept particularly useful and using it gives the false impression that you prefer higher unemployment rates,0
c finally the international market calls for vigilance against the sentiment of protectionism that would inevitably erode the relatively open commerce which has raised standards of living around the globe during the post world war ii era,0
like many communities and regions chicago and the midwest must continually reinvent themselves if they are to sustain their high standard of living and their size and importance,0
importantly to get the economy moving these solutions must be effective enough to restore public confidence,0
for example the increase in home ownership is consistent with the development of parsons place a partnership led by the emerson park development corporation epdc to create affordable housing which is viewed as a catalyst for east st louiss economic comeback,0
in particular for the nation as a whole the rise in house prices   appears to have closely tracked economic fundamentalsincluding rising   household incomes high rates of household formation and historically   low mortgage interest rates,0
on the one hand we may need to tighten somewhat further if currently unexpected tailwinds emerge that push the economy too far beyond sustainable growth and employment levels potentially leading to unacceptably high inflation beyond our symmetric 2 percent objective,0
funcid173damentally ours is a society wedded to the competitive proccid173ess as a chief safeguard of the public interest,0
oust because we now know that part  of the reason for higher unemployment rates is the larger p r opor tion of teenagers in the labor force doesnt mean that teenagers are any less unemployed in fact the opposite,0
here are obvious elements of monopoly in labor markets which tends to make for large wage increases bearing no relation to productivity gains,0
solutions            many solutions have been proposed to deal with this interrelated set of social security problems,0
many of our key exports are  capital goods and overseas growth is especially rapid in the emerging  economies that are equipping increasing numbers of their workers with uptodate  capital goods,0
thanks to the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years and growth in wages consumers are upbeat about the economy,0
the essence of my inflation outlook is that  despite recent and anticipated falls in the unemployment rate i dont see such  pressures at this time,0
as a result there may be greater reluctance to pay up for labor even when labor markets are very tight given the difficulty in passing on higher wage costs in higher prices,0
the best gauge of the strength of new jerseys economy is the solid growth in jobs that we have seen in the last few years and the tightening of the labor market,0
the recovery of house prices has increased household wealth,0
and with the unemployment rate at the lowest level since the 1960s  both nationally and locally  you shouldnt have trouble finding a place to startpreparing these remarks ladies and gentlemen made me realize something i hadnt expected to confront,0
b in the past of course inflation usually started to accelerate when growth was so strong and the unemployment rate fell to such a low level,0
according to the phillips curve as the unemployment  rate falls the growing scarcity of workers should push up on wages and prices,0
the board has recently proposed changes to the home ownership and equity protection act hoepa and to hmda in an effort to enhance the publics and the regulatory agencies understanding of the home mortgage market in general and the subprime market in particular,0
this is despite considerable monetary stimulus and relatively healthy labor markets,0
our objective is to promote maximum sustainable employment and stable prices over time,0
on the monetary side the feds longerterm success in reducing inflation and inflation expectations the resulting decline in mortgage rates and other longterm interest rates and our shortterm policy easings over the last 2½ years have helped produce a financial environment that should sustain spending in the housing sector where it is already strong and encourage increased spending by both consumers and business firms,0
the other indicator of an imbalance between demand and supply growth is the gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the last few years,0
4 i prefer a discretionary monetary policy formulated and activated by the central bank  always toward the goal of sustainable growth high employment and a stable currency,0
journalists are critical in helping the public understand the economics of the mortgage market which has become more accessible yet also more complex than ever,0
also tighter labor markets are feeding into somewhat higher wage growth,0
consumption growth would weaken as downwardly revised profit expectations limit stock market gains thereby reducing household wealth and as moreforesighted consumers perceive that smaller productivity gains portend lower real wage growth,0
the rapid growth in household debt largely reflects a surge in mortgage borrowing which has been fueled by historically low mortgage interest rates and strong growth in house prices,0
still the sum of these improvements in labor market hiring and job search efficiency continues to be difficult to quantify,0
in the area of disclosure the federal reserve is responsible for writing the regulation that implements the truth in lending act tila known as regulation z  the purpose of regulation z is to ensure that lenders provide borrowers or potential borrowers with clear accurate and timely information about the terms and conditions of loans,0
while stronger financial positions have helped the extremely weak labor market has been a restraining influence on consumer spending,0
certainly these developments are noteworthy but they are not enough to explain the slow employment growth,0
viewed through this lens the slow rate of labor market improvement in 2015 is not all that surprising,0
as the labor market has weakened wage growth has tapered off,0
at the same time there are significant social costs associated with delaying the recovery in labor market conditions too long,0
large chart to be clear some  of this slow recovery in employment can be attributed to a key demographic  force an increasing fraction of the people aged 16 and over reach retirement  age every year,0
and weve seen solid job growth in business services leisure and hospitality and retail among other industries,0
in addition to opening export markets and encouraging domestic saving without restricting imports or erecting new trade barriers thought might be given to efforts to increase public understanding and reduce trade paranoia,0
despite the almost 2percentagepoint rise in mortgage rates on new originations from mid1999 to mid2000 the average interest rate on outstanding mortgage debt rose only slightly as did debt service,0
these phenomena are reflected in high vacancy rates and the proliferation of special rental discounts,0
much of the softness in our labor markets can be traced back to our manufacturing industries,0
these developments likely spurred homeowners to tap increasing home equity to finance consumer expenditures beyond home purchase,0
they are promoting stable prices and fostering maximum employment,0
nationally there are at least some encouraging signs of a pickup so far this year2 the fact that some large companies such as walmart and target have announced wage increases for their employees also might be a sign that larger wage gains are on the horizon,0
that reduction corresponds to lower living standards for many americans,0
conclusion  summing up i am concerned about the rather slow growth the economy has had this year and the lack of progress in reducing unemployment,0
some commentators have expressed concern about the rapid growth in household debt in recent years,0
given the momentum of strong inflationary expectations and the usual lag with which policy actions work it should not have been surprising that inflation was not stopped in its tracks by the slightly restrictive measures taken in 1969 our banks model of the economy indicated in late 1969 that price rises could not be halted quickly without incurring a severe temporary rise in unemployment,0
labor market progress this year as measured by the kansas city feds labor market conditions indicators has been notable with this index of 24 labor market indicators since december 2020 closing twothirds of its shortfall relative to its prepandemic level2 nonetheless factors related to the pandemic such as caregiving obligations and ongoing fears of the virus continue to weigh on employment and participation,0
and while the employment situation seems to have stabilized after 12 months of job losses it wouldnt surprise me to see some more months of slow job growth just as we saw in the 1991 recovery,0
these factors will no doubt slow growth somewhat but with the job market improving and the momentum of the expansion at our backs moderate growth in consumer spending is the most likely outcome,0
however to my mind some uncertainty about that sustainability remains arising primarily from the slow recovery of the labor market,0
part of the reason consumer spending was able to grow more rapidly than income over that period was the rise in household wealth,0
if the decline in manufacturing and the increase in outsourcing are not to blame what else might have caused weak employment growth,0
this consensus statement serves as a quasiconstitutional document that clarifies that the committees inflation objective is 2 percent as measured by the annual change in the pce price index that this objective is symmetric that the maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors affecting the structure and dynamics of the labor market and that the committee will take a balanced approach to promote its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation under circumstances in which the committee judges that those objectives are not complementary,0
focusing on workers displaced by trade in particular kletzer 2001 found that job losers in industries facing high levels of import competition were slightly less likely to be reemployed and experienced greater earnings losses at about 13 percent on average than workers displaced from industries facing less import competition,0
this year monthly job gains have averaged 180000 below last years pace but still sufficient to reduce labor market slack,0
it also allows us to identify those industries that have had upward trends but that have experienced a period of relatively weak job growth in recent years,0
but we could improve the publics understanding of our monetary policy strategy if we provided more interpretation of those facts  namely our assessment of how recent changes in economic and financial data have or have not changed the mediumrun outlook the risks around that outlook and therefore the appropriate policy path,0
furthermore the income losses associated with a weaker employment picture would be a direct factor restraining consumer spending,0
confusion already exists because people qualify for full benefits under medicare at age 65 and full benefits under social security at an age nearing 66   as the nra increases for social security the disparity will widen and the confusion will grow,0
measures of slack such as the unemployment rate are often thought to prevent inflation from rising,0
h ow ever slowing growth in the labor force competition for investment funds from domestic and international sources and low er consumption are likely to keep overall growth from being as strong as in the 1970s and 1980s,0
and slower growth in the labor force will motivate employers to retain or attract older workersfor example through higher wages more flexibility in work schedules increased training directed toward older workers and changes in the retirement incentives provided by pension plans,0
in other signs of labor market conditions i expect job creation to remain strong in 2018 i should note that as the market continues to tighten we will eventually see job creation slow  ultimately if trends remain as they are we wont need much more than about 100000 a month 1  to keep up with population growth,0
most of the existing unemployment represents mismatch  that is not readily amenable to monetary policy1 given  the structural problems in the labor market i do not expect unemployment to  decline rapidly,0
although declines in manufacturing employment are a part of the story they arent the whole story,0
when the labor market is tight the unemployment rate is below the natural rate and wages and prices tend to rise,0
  payroll employment fell slightly in both september and october,0
oil prices are near record levels food prices have risen rapidly prices for a wide range of commodities are up and dollar depreciation is among the causes pushing up import prices,0
they too concluded that mismatches accounted for only a small amount of the increase in the unemployment rate during the recessionon the order of 34 to 112 percentage points11           in sum i do not think arguments suggesting that structural factors account for most of the increase in unemployment are persuasive either individually or collectively,0
third because there is a plethora of incoming economic data and information which can send confusing signals our communications rather than merely providing an accounting of the changes in economic conditions should help the public to better understand policymakers consensus assessment of what is signal versus noise in the data,0
consumer spending will be damped by the effects on real incomes of a weak labor market and rising energy prices and by the effects of declines in the stock market and home prices on household wealth,0
sentiment was building on the fomc to raise the federal funds rate to head off the risk of rising inflation9 but chairman greenspan had a hunch that the united states was experiencing the wonders of a new economy in which improved productivity growth would allow faster output growth and lower unemployment without serious inflation risks,0
it is encouraging that we have begun to see some evidence of stronger demand for homes and consumer goods and services,0
however some important headwindsin particular constrained bank lending and a weak job marketlikely will prevent the expansion from being as robust as we would hope,0
community colleges serve those who have been hit hardest by recent job loss women minorities and young people,0
lockhart there has been broadbased evidence of steadily improving employment conditions with net payroll jobs being added at a monthly rate averaging 241000 jobs so far this year,0
yet previous recessions do not seem to have been accompanied by notable increases in structural unemployment,0
in fact by many nationallevel measures our labor market is very strong,0
instead we could promote financial inclusion more efficiently by for example encouraging widespread use of lowcost commercial bank accounts through the cities for financial empowerment bank on project11 could it be that a cbdc is needed because existing payment services are unreasonably expensive,0
in addition the indirect effects of the commodity price surge could be amplified substantially if longerrun inflation expectations started drifting upward or if nominal wages began rising sharply as workers pressed employers to offset realized or prospective declines in their purchasing power,0
although job cuts in the united states appear to have tapered off in recent months the share of jobless receiving extended unemployment benefits has continued to grow,0
still 18 months into recovery there are more than 7 million fewer jobs in the economy than there were just prior to the recession and the unemployment rate remains stubbornly close to its peak,0
were such step undertaken we would see a significant rebound in gnp growth and with that som significant declines in unemployment,0
a flat phillips curve has important advantages the labor market can strengthen a lot and pull many workers who may have been sidelined back into productive employment without an acceleration in inflation unlike what we saw in the 1960s and 1970s,0
return  note that john haltiwanger argues that there has been a longerrun decline in labor market fluidity,0
that is about the same improvement as in the larger chicago metro area where unemployment has fallen to 812 percent,0
but to get most of the economic benefits from  college like the faster wage growth you have to stay a learner for years and  years and years,0
and wage growth is picking upearnings have increased 31 percent over the past 12 months and even more for lowerpaying jobs,0
civilian unemployment fell to 67 percent in december though and has held steady at that level through february,0
we have seen sustained strong job growth of about 175000 monthly over the past year,0
the next question the review will consider is are existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability or should the toolkit be expanded,0
in my view our current policy stance is appropriate given the outlook of growth near its trend pace solid labor market conditions and inflation rates not far from the fomcs symmetric 2 percent objective and given the risks around the outlook that we continue to monitor,0
consumer spending which represents about twothirds of output picked up in the second quarter supported by growth in personal income and continued improvement in household balance sheets,0
of course not all stickyprice firms  will raise their prices in lockstep with each other,0
finally i would note the possibility that inflation may rise more sharply in response to robust labor market conditions than anticipated,0
by the way the main essay in our 2000 annual report is about improving working conditions,0
i am hopeful that these efforts along with a continued strong job market will encourage more people to joinâU0080U0094or in some cases rejoinâU0080U0094the construction trades,0
with overall population growth continuing to slow and labor force participation not expected to rise we probably need to adjust our benchmarks for what level of employment growth is consistent with economic growth near potential and a steady unemployment rate,0
i see output continuing to  grow slowlyat  around 25 percent in 2013 and around 3 percent in 2014 i expect unemployment to  continue to fall only slowly down to around 75 percent in late 2013  and around 7 percent in late 2014 this level of unemployment will continue to  constrain wage growth,0
i would not underestimate the challenge of calibrating monetary policy to sustain full employment and reanchor trend inflation around 2 percent while adjusting to sizable stimulus at a time when resource constraints are tightening and the economy is growing above trend,0
2  and will a tight job market eventually increase pressures on wages,0
and the worse off have benefitted from stimulus checks enhanced unemployment benefits and forbearance,0
however under our new framework policy decisions going forward will be based on the fomcs estimates of shortfalls of employment from its maximum levelâU0080U0094not deviations,0
by focusing on eliminating shortfalls from maximum employment rather than deviations in either direction and on the achievement of inflation that averages 2 percent over time monetary policy can take a patient approach rather than a preemptive approach,0
by 1986 the unemployment rate had soared to 11,0
declining home and equity values worsening income prospects because of a deteriorating labor market and a general unease about the economy have strained finances in many households,0
  it looks as though employment growth will not be as strong as the ___ million new jobs we created in 98,0
meanwhile throughout the year firms were hiring workers at an impressive pace and labor markets continued to tighten the unemployment rate fell to 412 percent in the fourth quarter down from 5 percent at the end of the previous year,0
and finally in this regard as the engine for the top regional economic performer in the nation atlanta is enjoying healthy job growth as well as business expansion and relocation in both the service and manufacturing sectors,0
another sort of policy implication that i read from the growing problem of high unemployment among the young is the need to look closely at the minimum wage law,0
the first quarter saw strong employment growth and perhaps fairly weak output growth while the current quarter is witnessing a weakening in employment growth just as economic activity is accelerating,0
michael moskow speeches  1998  7  that seems to be a factor in the regions slower job growth compared to the nation during the past two years,0
the us lost 88 million jobs from the peak of employment in january 2008 to the trough in employment in february 2010 we have gained back 35 million lost jobs or 40 percent but it will take some time before we once again see a truly vibrant labor market,0
so even  though employment grew it seems that there was an improvement opportunity the  fomc should have facilitated even faster employment growth,0
here again monetary policy would not be an effective tool to address such real economic challenges as slower labor force or productivity growth,0
i close my discussion of price stability by circling back to a question about the employment mandate that i posed earlier should the fomc have stimulated more rapid employment growth,0
i believe he agrees with me on the following new technologymainly information and communications technologyand new processes based on the new technology are driving an investment boom that is raising productivity increasing growth and reducing unemployment to 30year lows,0
productivity may be able to sustain close to a 4 percent growth rate even if employment growth slows somewhat,0
the reduced fear of job loss is likely to foster more consumer spending,0
nonetheless with stillsluggish job growth i expect this number to average out about where it currently is at a little under 7 percent for the year,0
for example when the housing industry suffers because of  high mortgage rates erroneously attributed to tight control of credit by the fed we are inevitably called upon to attempt to lower interest rates by injecting additional credit and money into the economy,0
these include the cost  and price increases associated with the minimum wage socialsecurity and unemploymentinsurance taxes the steel reference price system sugar and grain price supports postal rates energy policy the recent coal settlement and so on,0
and one in five manufacturing jobs disappeared in the region from 1979 to 1983 to their credit the remaining workers and businesses began to rebuild and restructure during the late 1980s,0
as a result of these challenges texas job growth slowed to approximately 13 percent in 2015 and dallas fed economists expect similar growth in 20165 this compares with the 36 percent job growth the state experienced in 20146 while the texas energy and manufacturing sectors have been losing jobs the states service sector has shown steady moderate expansion,0
putting all these pieces together i do not expect a large increase in labor force participation,0
conclusion ultimately an equitable workforce recovery isnt merely a nice to have nor is it exclusively a moral issue for our society  though it is in my view precisely that,0
economic outlook and views on monetary policy to give you the punchline i think the outlook for growth in economic activity and the labor market is good,0
by either measure the rate of expansion should decelerate and as a result unemployment will probably decline less dramatically than in the last two years,0
our expansion was led by consumers whose purchases o f homes cars appliances and a myriad o f durable and nondurable items spurred businesses to increase production build their inventories and expand their work forces,0
and the feds actions have helped keep  unemployment from rising higher,0
meanwhile now that the babyboom generation has been absorbed into the work force and the number of new workers is diminishing labor markets have begun to show signs of tightening,0
if growth were to continue at last years pace while the number o f  new workers declines labor costs would tend to rise in the absence o f stronger advances in productivity,0
it remains to be seen for example whether the trend toward consolidation and layoffs in banking communication transportation and other professional and business services has bottomed out,0
consumer debt service as a percent of income for example has fallen to levels not seen since 1986 as a result households are in a better position to purchase goods that are typically financed with credit and the cost of doing this is much lower than before,0
consumer debt service as a  percentage of income for example has fallen to levels not seen since 1986  as a result  households are in a better position to purchase goods that are typically financed with credit and the cost of doing so is much lower than before,0
recent employment gains should also provide support for further increases in personal income and consumer spending,0
too quick an adjustment can cause too much pain and i personally believe policymakers must be attuned to these social costs,0
much of the decline in the unemployment rate over the past three years has occurred because the fraction of people who are looking for work has fallen,0
this puts upward pressure on employment and  prices,0
the cyclical part of inflation accounts for only about 40 percent of core pce inflation but it has continued to rise over the expansion as the labor market has continued to tighten,0
we noted that conditions in financial  markets were continuing to improve household spending was stabilizing but  remained constrained by ongoing job losses sluggish income growth lower  housing wealth and tight credit and businesses were making progress in aligning  inventories with stillanemic sales and were continuing to cut back on fixed  investment and payrolls,0
nevertheless even if we could ensure significantly more rapid productivity growth than we have seen recently there are valid reasons for wishing to avoid ongoing declines in the general price level,1
whether these pressures are in fact passed through to core inflation will depend on a host of considerations including the willingness of producers to absorb those cost increases and experience at least for a time lower profit margins,1
furthermore the growing number of wage settlements in excess of the wage price guideposts justify forebodings that rising unit labor costs might easily provide an impetus to still higher prices from the supply side of the equation,1
more recently however the prices of oil and other commodities have posted substantial declines nonoil import prices have edged down and the prospect of greater slack in resource markets and weak demand seems likely to restrain labor cost pressures and pricing power,1
these values amounted in the four states respectively in 1950 to 15750 18000 20830 and 27660the percentage of tenant operators decreased 36 per cent in minnesota 51 per cent in north dakota 42 per cent in south dakota and 47 per cent in montana indicating an increasing proportion of owner operators who need both investment and operating capitalchanges in operating costs are illustrated by the following wage cost increases ranged from 150 per cent in montana to 330 per cent in south dakota feed from 287 per cent in tiorth dakota to 530 per cent in minnesota and fuel and oil from 197 per cent in minnesota to 328 per cent in south dakotathese figures do more than illustrate the tremendous increase in credit requirements of the average farmer today,1
indeed when one factors the oil price effects out of the recent cpi data it appears to me that the underlying inflation rate still is in the 3 to 4 percent rangewith a risk that the numbers could start coming in higher when the effects of rising import prices start to become more pronouncedi do not want to leave you however with the impression that all is lost,1
given these circumstances some slowdown in business activity seems to be both likely and desirable in 1979  further stimulus of the type  experienced in the past year or so will not lead to further growth but only to everworsening inflation,1
reductions in interest rates usually expand credit and encourage firms to invest and households to borrow for durable goods purchases thereby stimulating aggregate demand,1
through the socalled wealth effect these gains have tended to foster increases in aggregate demand beyond the increases in supply,1
if real gnp growth advances because of increases in aggregate supply federal reserve attempts to prevent overheating would lead to suboptimal employment of resources and policy error,1
under this alternative worldview a string of adverse supply shocks is dangerous because it has the potential to cause rising inflation to become embedded in expectations,1
if productivity growth falters labor costs will increase more rapidly and at some point firms will attempt to recoup some of these costs in the form of higher product prices,1
the major objective of our monetary policy has been to create an environment conducive to a sustained recovery in business activity while maintaining the financial market discipline needed to foster price stability,1
in addition international supply chains made possible by advances in communication and transportation reduce costs and increase the competitiveness of us firms,1
last months further trimming of inventories in the manufacturing sector combined with a 25 increase in shipments brought the inventorytosales ratio in that sector to near the prerecession levels of early 1981 and should set the stage for further gains in production and employment,1
today the opportunity before us is to continue breaking away from a cycle of accelerating inflation depressed business investment declining productivity and loss of international market sharethe early characteristics of this recovery do not indicate a need to alter the direction nor the objectives of monetary policy,1
however these expenditures must be made in the face of todays high cost of capital both in the equity and credit markets2digitized for fraser httpfraserstlouisfedorg federal reserve bank of st louis2 how canfortable should forecastings past failures make you feel about the current consensus of business economists that real growth in 1984 will be near 5 percent and that inflation will run between 5 percent and 6 percent,1

the question i raise is whether foreign competition higher productivity and present management and employee attitudes may have deferred reinf1ationthese analyses leave open the questions what would strongly rising business investment in equipment and plant really mean in terms of reinvesting in our society,1
their decline in turn would provide a powerful factor supporting and encouraging the business investment we need to maintain economic momentum and to support productivity growth7digitized for fraser httpfraserstlouisfedorg federal reserve bank of st louissustainable economic growth and prosperity requires public economic policies having multiple objectives,1
accelerating productivity allows wages to rise without comparable increases in unit labor costs and keeps costpush inflationif you believe in such a thingat bay,1
a decline in the tradeweighted dollar erodes the profit margins of foreign vendors and perhaps those of their distributors in the us this process is not likely to produce instant inflation however as sellers may accept smaller margins on sales to hold their shares of us marketsfinally let me note that some analysts became concerned that reinflation was suggested by the conroerce departments flash estimate for the first quarter of this year which showed the osip deflator advancing at a 512 percent rate confirmed by the revised estimate released last week,1
1in fact three or four tenths of the one percentage point increase are due to changes in how productivity is measured rather than to a true increase in productivity growth,1
reductions in europe in marginal tax rates such as those introduced in the united states in 1981 as ell as those proposed recently by president reagan have the potential to contribute to a revitalization of european econanies with rrore rapid growth in output and nost inprtantly jobs,1
industrial production has risen over 4 per cent a year since the spring of 1960 also a much better record than at any time since the korean war,1
the structure of the model starts with the standard textbook equation for aggregate demand for domestically produced goods namely2   rmad  c  i  g  nx next is the wageprice block which is based on a wage or price phillips curve,1
nonetheless the nature of the downside risks this time is different and it is not too difficult to envision a scenario in which adverse shifts in business sentiment and uncertainty over the outlook cause firms not only to reduce capital spending but also to pull back on hiring which then causes consumer sentiment and spending to weaken and unemployment to rise with inflation staying below our target because of weak aggregate demand,1
you know that employment and output growth has slowed markedly since mid84 despite declining interest rates and very rapid money growth,1
the counsel was not to fret that capital investment will be reenergized as aggregate demand grows,1
as we have seen the european countries have proven averse to stimulating domestic demand,1
with a changing mix of economic indicators though the goal remains the same contributing to further disinflation and building upon our progress to date  which has been achieved at such considerable cost in such difficult times9 is serious political discussion of measures to encourage their private sectors stimulate domestic investment and even reverse the flight of capital,1
to a first approximation one could assume that the rate of bias is constant and does not account for the estimated decline in productivity growth and that we should not dismiss the slowdown as an artifact of measurement difficulties3 that is the conclusion most researchers reach but the data issue is not settled,1
into this inflationary situation was added the massive 150 percent increase in the price of imported oil,1
during the past recession and recent recovery consumer spending held up unusually well,1
and more recently automobile sales in july picked up noticeablyan improvement in consumer spending and housing does not mean that the recession has ended,1
however the positive national prospects for single     7 family housing and increased consumer spending bode well for several other important southeastern industries,1
in that year with inflation falling domestic operating profit margins started to rise indicating that increases in unit costs were slowing,1
that meant using the tools of monetary policy fairly actively to combat recessionary tendencies when they appeared and to restrain the economy when the degree of slack in labor and product markets diminished to a point where pressures on wage and prices began to threaten,1
phase iv controls have a role to play here by limiting wage and price increases until broader policy restraints can take hold,1
progress against inflation will continue however only if we succeed in reducing the rise in unit costs of production particularly labor costs which amount to roughly twothirds of the total,1
industrial production fell 12 percent in both march and april and capacity utilization is under 75 percent,1
in addition business investment was strong last year boosted in part by a variety of changes to the tax code,1
the long advance in profits reflected probably more than anything else the absence of the imbalances in pricecost relationships which in previous expansions had produced sharp but shortlived increases in profit margins in the first year of rapid economic growth,1
this improved performance likely reflected the eventual recognition that productivity growth had increased on a sustained basis,1
as a result most of the growth in total output in 1956 flowed into business investment which expanded at a rate that cannot be expected to persist indefinitely,1
in september industrial production increased a full percentage point and personal incomes also rose,1
so far this year the rapid rise in corporate profits has carried them to previous highs in dollar amounts although as a percent of gnp and of sales they remain low compared to past periodsa general view would seem to be thatthe 55 per cent wage standard may translate into a 6 per cent rise in actual compensationif compensation rises by 6 per cent and output per manhour by 35 per cent then unit labor costs would increase by 25 per cent,1
third advancing technology appears to be an important driving force behind the exceptionally strong rise in business investment in durable equipment,1
a further rise in aggregate demand for goods and services is likely to induce a sharp rise of inventory investment given the present condition of inventories relative to sales,1
although the monthly readings have been volatile the overall data suggest that consumer spending picked up in the second quarter after being subdued in the first quarter,1
the amount of external drag on the domestic economy reached a peak in the third quarter of last year when declining net exports reduced the annual growth rate of real gnp by almost four percentage pointsa record for any postwar quarter,1
indeed it is my judgment that the rise in the real value of the dollar over the past four years has had a  direct depressing effect on aggregate demand for goods and services roughly as large as the stimulative effect of the increase since early 1981 in the structural deficit in the federal budgetlet me turn now to the role that monetary policy may have played in shaping the general contours of this recovery,1
moreover consumer price inflation rises due both to higher import prices and because the stimulus to activity raises the marginal costs of domestic producers,1
the weaker canadian dollar is boosting manufacturing activity and exports and consumer spending has been stronger than expected,1
3 other influences crop losses both here and abroad operated adversely on prices of agricultural commodities the continued depreciation of the dollar resulted in higher prices for imported goods ranging from wines to volkswagens capacity constraints reached in 1973 in such industries as plastics chemicals lumber and paper had a lingering effect on prices in 1974 consumer and business confidence was jolted by the disclosures of watergate and the strains evident in the financial system as reflected in the failure of the franklin national bank,1
during the first half of the decade productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an unusually high average annual rate of about 3 percent,1
business fixed investment grew by a little less than 6 percent a healthy number to be sure but far from a transformative year,1
but more importantly it reflects the strong domestic demand for goods and services as our growth continued,1
is slow domestic demand likely to be persistent or transient,1
this improvement has been reflected here at home in dollar depreciation higher earnings and stock prices tighter risk spreads and an increase in net exports which made a small positive contribution in the first half of this year after holding down gdp growth over the past several years,1
supporting this result ihrig and others 2007 conclude that correlations between real gdp growth and real domestic demand growth have declined in recent decades in the united states and several other industrial economies,1
new strategies to improve earning power and improve risk management will be required,1
in such a holding company additional powers would be granted to separate subsidiaries and the insured deposittaking subsidiary would be insulated from the risks of its affiliates by appropriate prohibitions or limitations on intercompany financing or transfers of capital,1
united states banks today find themselves faced with higher capital costs and higher funding costs than many of their competitors,1
reduced confidence in turn could undercut the moderate strength of consumer spending which would undercut any significant increase in business investment beyond ordinary replacement spendingto sum up on the outlook in all candor this is one of the more difficult situations to evaluate weve seen in recent years,1
at the local level we all understand the importance of such things as streets and roads or water and sewer systems that support private development and investment in housing in downtown development and neighborhood revitalization in industrial facilities and small business growth,1
the secap partners also noted that financial institutions should continue to strive to expand their small business lending to underserved areas,1
businesses have found it necessary to continue to downsize their work forces and to cut other costs to improve their ability to compete here and abroad,1
for example if labor productivity is increasing then companies can pay workers more and still not affect their profit marginsin fact they may even be able to increase their profits,1
during the two years of falling employment   productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose about 5 percent per year,1
if growth in overall output is going to rise substantially then we would need to see an increase in labor productivity growth or in employment growth or both,1
further out i admit to being a bit of technoenthusiast and i see the potential for many emerging technologies including 5g communications artificial intelligence and machine learning and 3d printing to further boost productivity growth in the coming years,1
michael moskows take a international experience should make us a little more skeptical of attributing the recent large acceleration in productivity growth solely to advances in technology,1
hence even a fairly sizable onetime adjustment in import prices b itself would not necessarily be a critical setback for our antiinflation effortsserious difficulties would arise however if the increase in import prices started getting built into the domestic economy through wageprice interactions or through expecta tional effects,1
in my remarks ill provide my personal views on these questions and ill offer some thoughts on state and local workforce development efforts as a way to improve labor productivity,1
in the year 1955 we enjoyed an extraordinarily high level of consumer expenditures for automobiles for housing and for many durable goods,1
a higher value of the dollar passes through to lower import prices which hold down us inflation both because imports make up part of final consumption and because lower prices for imported components hold down business costs more generally,1
high quality corporations to circumvent conmercial banks in securing credit,1
in a society such as ours which rightly values full employment monetary and fiscal tools are inadequate for dealing with sources of price inflation such as are plaguing us nowthat is pressures on costs arising from excessive wage increases,1
discussions about financial assistance for small businesses focused on the need for small loans for startup companies and the need to be vigilant against race and gender biases or discrimination in the small business credit market,1
these tend to squeeze profit margins hurt investment and generally cause misallocation of resourcesthe unfortunate fiscal and monetary policy mix which has caused us to fight inflation by tight money and then to offset its effects by easy budgets has also been adverse to investment and productivity,1
there is no escape from the logic that wage increases in excess of productivity growth result in rising prices,1
during the first halfyear following the low point in output productivity gains and increased hours tend to account for much of digitized for fraser httpfraserstlouisfedorg federal reserve bank of st louis 10the output growth,1
but productivity has continued to rise at about a 4 per cent rate in manufacturing even though the current expansion has continued for over three and onehalf years,1
second the slowing of aggregate demand globally has also depressed the prices of oil and other commodities,1
8in view of the huge expansion in production and employcid173ment that we have experienced during the past year it would have been difficult to avoid an appreciable upward movement of the price level even with a balanced federal budget,1
the strong demand for goods and services that we associate with prosperity causes wages to be raised not only in manufacturing where the increases can be offset in part at least by mechanization but in the service enterprises like stores hotels and hospitals where there is less chance for similar offsets,1
this may lower the rate of productivity growth for a time,1
some areas that had previously been relatively immune to national 3  economic recessions have this time experienced much sharper declines in business activity and rapid increases in unemployment,1
3   the related growth in salaries in this higher wage sector should  help bolster consumer spending,1
still others suggest that labcr demands for wage increases exceed gains in productivity or that the rise in prices stems from the impetus to public and private spending that is giilen by the enormous expansion of debt of all kinds,1
while uncertainty is a source of embarrassment to forecasters it has very real costs to us businesses and households by creating unnecessary inefficiencies and lowering our productivity growth,1
this is evidenced by the fact that despite cutbacks in spending on new it investments strong productivity growth has continued throughout the recent recession and thus far in the recovery,1
19  new plant and equipment should increase at least 13 percent this year  20  despite the continuation of shortages of certain parts and materials,1
furthermore as i just discussed productivity growth has slowed,1
during the years of strong productivity gains workers and their families became accustomed to generous increases in their real incomes,1
when we have higher rates of productivity growth we have higher rates of gdp growth,1
the consumer too will intensify the ups and downs of the business cycle if he persists in flashing his new credit cards without discretion in times of prosperity only to lay them aside entirely when even a moderate recession sets ini have dealt with three major criticisms related to our growth rate  that unemployment is too high that public service outlays are too small and that business fluctuations are too large,1
i learned about the key role that community banks play in helping small businesses get started and flourish,1
this picture has not been improving because real  consumer spending has risen at only a 11 percent annual rate over the last six  months,1
similarly a stronger labor market can provide a modest countervailing factor to income inequality trends by leading to higher wages at the bottom rungs of the wage scale,1

reflecting the very rapid increases in hourly compensation and the absence of productivity gains unit labor costs have risen at an extremely rapid rate in the last year,1
this phase is characterized by a major acceleration in us productivity          growth and the decline in what economists call home bias the parochial          tendency to invest domestic savings in ones home country,1
 i will not debate that point i am addressing a convention  6of professional economists not moral philosophers or political scientistsanalyzing the issue as a matter of economic engineeringi believe that the experiences of the 1970s here and abroad have demonstrated the practical difficulties of sustaining growth and productivity on the shifting sands of a progressively weakening and uncertain currency,1
one of the st louis feds specialties for example is to develop new software applications for the us treasury which is increasing 3  federal reserve  its use of electronic receipts and payments to reduce costs and improve services,1
business sentiment remains at high levels and our business contacts in manufacturing and services report increasing demand consistent with readings from national and regional business surveys,1
similarly the region had enjoyed the benefits of a sharp increase in production and employment in the oil and gas extraction sector as new technologies were brought to bear but the sharp drop in oil prices since mid2014 has resulted in a significant slowdown in natural gas and oil exploration in the marcellus and utica shale regions which include northern ohio and western pennsylvania,1
rather the effectiveness with which we have invested both domestic saving and funds attracted from abroad is the apparent source of our decadelong rise in productivity growth,1
recent slower economic growth is largely connected with less rapid consumer spending growth and a slowing in business capital spending,1
the combination of weak growth and strong hiring in this expansion implies small increases in output per hour or productivity,1
but this simple answer only begs another question w h y do some economies have high levels of capital and technology while others don t,1

in real terms the level of consumer spending on goods is about 16 percent higher than it was before the pandemic while that on services is still about 5 percent below,1
until a few months ago aggregate demands both governrrental and private for scarce materials and labor pressed hard upon our resources and prices rose as a result,1
throughout this expansion business investment spending has grown much faster than weve seen in previous expansions,1
and as wage increases result in rising labor costs employers are likely to raise prices to maintain profit margins,1
over the last three years real consumer spending has increased at an annual rate of 225 percent,1
a large share of the rise in debt public and private was accid173counted for by residential mortgagesthis time 42 per cent of the 27 billion rise in total debt as against 29 per cent of the 45 billion rise in 1955 there was also superimposed on rising consumer spending an extraordinary expansion of plant and equipment,1
it may have failed to take into account the strong brakes upon inflationary price rises especially of manufactured articles that are provided by excess productive capacity and increased productive efficiencyif these economic forces are accompanied by realistic wage bargaining realistic pricing that will keep our firms competitive and the determination of our nation to turn away from deficit spending except in dire emergencies and to return to the paths of prudence inflation can and will be stoppeddigitized for fraser httpfraserstlouisfedorg federal reserve bank of st louismonetary misconceptions charles dickens opens a 1ill of q ci with some observations about the state of europe a century and a half ago 11it was the best of times it was the worst of times it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness  it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair,1
but globalization impacts the conduct of business so                            much more profoundly and therefore it impacts the expansion                            of our productive capacity and the pricing mechanism                            of labor and other inputs,1
the expansion of businesses loans tends to be sustained relatively more at the large banks with ready access to eurodollars during periods of monetary restraint than at other banks,1

as we assess the need for further policy action well need to remain especially vigilant for signs of increasing wage and price pressures,1
laws that protect against the threat of expropriation or government repudiation of contractsall of the rules that cumulatively sum to the protection of property rightsare important,1
rising government expenditures especially for defense have fostered strong gains in both output and employment in related industries,1
in the meantime previous increases in labor costs and the recent than above a year ago low productivity rates averaging less 1 per centin the last few quarters have combined to produce sharply higher costs per unit of output in manufacturing,1
the increase in the money supply then increased domestic demand for goods and services and put upward pressure on domestic prices,1
consumer spending continues to grow both as cause and effect of improving economic conditions,1
  we all went out and increased our purchases of goods and services at a rapid rate resulting in unusually strong spending growth of around five percent,1
recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate demand has moderated to a pace closer to the enhanced rate of growth of the economys potential to produce,1
a key reason overall gdp was so weak last quarter was consumer spending which rose only 06 percent at an annual rate,1
for example real residential fixed investment declined by about 40 and 45 percent respectively in the periods surrounding the 197375 and 198082 recessions1 by contrast real residential fixed investment has declined by about 13 percent since its peak in the third quarter of 2005 let me now turn to current economic developments in more detail which will set the stage for the outlook portion of my talk,1
one of the reasons for this trend is continued pressure on business profits because of slower growth overseas higher labor costs and intense competition which makes it harder for firms to increase prices,1
part of the modest pace of investment is likely because the effective labor force that will use this new capital has been expanding much less rapidly than in previous decades but it is also possible that investment has been restrained by the subdued outlook for growth and profits thereby generating less demand for expanding productive capacity6 however the slow growth in capital per worker has been quantitatively less importantaccounting for only onefourth of the slowdown in productivity compared with its longrun averagethan the decline in the growth rate of total factor productivity tfp the portion of productivity that is not accounted for by measurable inputs to production,1
still longterm rates increased only  slightly in 1977 despite the heavy volume of financing in the capital markets before rising noticeably in early 1978  this leads to the key  questioncan a strong business expansion continue in 1978 without sig nificant upward pressures on rates,1
  at that time the federal reserve noted that growing caution by lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets are likely to restrain aggregate demand in the future,1
as an example in six asian countries including china and india exports fell more than 30 percent by the beginning of 2009 and industrial production declined about 10 percent,1
consumer spending has been rising solidly of late likely a reflection of the boost to purchasing power from the lower oil prices as well as the ongoing job gains and a wealthtoincome ratio that remains high even after the recent declines in the stock market,1
the price index for personal consumption expenditure increased 31 percent over the 12 months that ended in may and is up at a 39 percent annual rate for the last 3 months,1
monetary policy and business cycle fluctuations at times during the recovery the public discussion seemed to suggest that by setting interest rates appropriately monetary policymakers could offset the deep shock that afflicted the economy and speed up the recovery,1
we experienced an unsustainably rapid increase in business spending on plant equipment and inventory to the point where business fixed investment expenditures were accounting for nearly 11 per cent of our gross national product  a level that had never been reached in previous postwar business cycles,1
then in the last half of 2009 while gdp and manufacturing production were increasing we lost an additional 11 million jobs,1
therefore in may we took the next step in our ongoing effort to enhance protections for consumers who use credit cards by proposing rules under the federal trade commission act to prevent financial harm to consumers from specific practices,1
stockholders management government and labor in the u s must work together to overcome this with the idea that the gains will be equably distributed by the price and wage structurenow some may argue that american labor in striving for more percentage wage increases than productivity increases can yield is simply trying to get part of the increase from corporate profit,1
a proinvestment policy agenda by the government could help address some of our nations longterm challenges by promoting investment in human capital particularly for those who have seen their share of the economic pie shrink and by encouraging research and development and other capital investments that increase the productive capacity of the nation,1
our analysis is based on the expectation that global oil supply will grow at a slower rate and that daily demand will continue to grow on average at approximately 13 million barrels per day for the remainder of 2016 and at a similar rate in 2017 this balancing process has been more painful and slower than some had anticipated,1
however much of the decline in import prices during this period was probably driven by movements in exchange rates and the effects of technological change on goods prices rather than by the growing integration of world markets7 in addition import prices have risen at about the same average pace as core consumer prices over the past several years and thus no longer appear to be acting as a significant restraint on inflation in the united states,1
and some of the factors that boosted the us trade deficit such as higher productivity growth or financial innovations that support greater spending may show up more fully in foreign economies,1
these data suggest that the increases in small business ownership and equity    investment by traditionally underserved populations result in part from    increased access to appropriate financing to fund the startup and growth    of businesses,1
for a vast nation such as ours at the cutting edge of technology a large pickup in productivity growth is difficult to envisage,1
first in the aftermath of the financial crisis there has been an unusually large and persistent shortfall in aggregate demand,1
this large decline likely reflects more than exchange rate appreciation alone but some drag on net exports from exchange rate appreciation is likely to persist,1
but without doubt it has played an important role in helping to boost aggregate demand in recent quarters,1
the employment and income generated by business spending on capital goods boosts consumer spending and sets off another round of investment spending,1
theres another possible factor that may not be temporarythat trend productivity growth has risen to a higher level as a result of strong investment in computers and other hightech equipment,1
conclusion a in conclusion its still too early to determine how long productivity will continue to increase at a higher rate,1
but faced with high fixed costs for labor plant and equipment it was less expensive to produce vehicles and sell them with heav y incentives than it was to shut down plants,1
one of the temporary factors is the strong dollar which has contributed to a fall in import prices,1
incoming data suggest reduced gains in consumer spending and unanticipated increases in inventories,1
then i consider how widespread these gains in productivity growth are around the world and speculate on reasons that productivity growth gains may be positive in some countries and not in others,1
capital formation particularly investment in information and communications technology played an instrumental role in the widely noted surge in productivity growth that took place in the late 1990s,1
regulations that protect intellectual property rights reward those with creative ideas and therefore can act to stimulate costreducing innovations,1
productivity growth accelerated significantly in the us during the boom years of the late 1990s,1
better jobs require more productive workers and pay higher wages,1
i say that accelerated labor productivity is arguably at the root of declining domestic valuedadded price inflation because it can be misleading to identify a single variable as the exogenous force in an essentially interactive process of cause and effect,1
i concluded then and continue to believe that the single most important factor explaining lagging job creation is the astonishing gains in labor productivity that have been achieved in the us economy in the past few years,1
it can be argued that the comparative absence of labor market rigidity in the united states results in comparatively large movements over time of workers between industries and sectors and across geography,1
many analysts now believe that the economys sustainable productivity growth rate is approximately 2 to 2½ percent,1
small business access to credit and bank supervision well as the old saying goes enough about me lets talk about you,1
real gross domestic product growth last year was a strong 4 percent or so but domestic spending growth was even stronger at about 5 percent,1
although we can expect productivity growth to remain strong throughout this decade growth in our workforce has started to slow a bit,1
i will then turn to the role of small businesses in our economy drawing on our research on small business finances and our efforts to promote small business access to capital and credit,1
as i mentioned earlier the core inflation rate has stayed relatively low in recent months as rapid gains in productivity have tended to offset cost increases,1
we already saw some indications of a shift down toward long run productivity growth at the end of last year,1
productivity growth in 2002 was an important factor contributing to an equally impressive growth in real disposable personal income of 43 percent,1
we realized some of each in the last half of the 1990s after productivity growth picked up,1
202  michael moskow speeches  1999  d its important to recognize that the labor market is more flexible and efficient than in the past,1
until market forces assisted by a vigilant federal reserve effect the necessary alignment of the growth of aggregate demand with the growth of potential aggregate supply the full benefits of innovative productivity acceleration are at risk of being undermined by financial and economic instability,1
the immediate  effect of this greater spending is to encourage increased output and employment growth,1
real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent in the first quarter building on an even larger increase in the second half of 2003 and it appears to have posted another sizable gain in the second quarter of this year,1
larry and most others i think felt that high productivity growth would resume once the slowdown is behind us,1
concerns about small business financing for minority and womenowned businesses have arisen because of the persistent differences observed in financing patterns by these groups as well as their underrepresentation in the business population,1
the employmenttopopulation ratio for primeage workers has also improved over the past year although it is still 2 percentage points lower than its precrisis peak in 2007 earlier this year many observers saw the prospect of fiscal stimulus as presenting the possibility of a substantial boost to domestic demand,1
before i begin i should note that i speak only for myself and not for my colleagues on the federal open market committee1 when we spoke last year i spent a fair amount of time on the list of factors that appear to have contributed to the decadelong boom in housing and housing finance that preceded and appear to have precipitated this recession and the associated financial turmoil2 the list included historically strong growth in productivity which passed through to growth in real income and the demand for housing low longterm real interest rates technologically driven improvements in retail credit delivery which lowered borrowing spreads and expanded access to credit and a regulatory regime which may not have adequately contained the moral hazard associated with perceptions that many large financial institutions including especially the governmentsponsored housing finance intermediaries fannie mae and freddie mac were too big to fail,1
from 1995 to 2001 nonfarm labor productivity grew at an annual rate of nearly 25 percent more than a percentage point faster than the disappointing performance seen from 1973 to 1995 increases in business efficiency boosted expectations of the future growth of corporate earnings,1
this is a point i have also made in the past14 while there is disagreement about what the most effective policies would be some combination of more encouragement for private investment improved public infrastructure better education and more effective regulation is likely to promote faster growth of productivity and living standardsand also to reduce the probability that the economy and particularly the central bank will in the future have to contend with the effective lower bound,1
return to text 3 since domestic saving less domestic investment is          equal with small adjustments to the current account balance the dispersion          of domestic saving less domestic investment among nations is a very close          approximation to the dispersion of current account deficits,1

early in recoveries businesses tend to increase output by employing existing workforces more intensively,1
although overall gdp edged down at an average annual rate of only 02 percent in the first three quarters of 2001 the decline in business investment subtracted nearly 2 percentage points from gdp growth over that period,1
but the odds would seem to favor a more measured response to the inevitable tightening of policy as the recovery in business investment picks up steam consistent with keeping the economy on a sustainable growth track rather than becoming another source of macroeconomic instability,1

the pace of consumer spending after slowing some at the end of last year looks to have picked up in january and auto sales remained strong in february,1
along with these domestic risks global risks are also considered in my outlook given downward revisions in forecasts for gross domestic product growth in most major economies,1
will that happen again or will the current strong run of productivity growth sustain itself a good while longer,1
the higher  prices in this forecast are due in large part to the lifting of oil prices from very low 1986 levels but also to the rise in prices of other imports which as o f the end o f the third quarter were up 7 percent,1
higher social security taxes will also increase business costs besides cutting takehome pay,1
real disposable personal income peaked in september of 2007 and consumer spending growth then slowed dampened as well by the decline in household wealth due to falling house prices,1

strong property rights a crucial element in financial development severely constrain a governments ability to expropriate land factories or ideas whenever it wants to profit from them,1
financial pressures on financial institutions and households have contributed in turn to greater caution in the extension of credit and to slower growth in consumer spending,1
assuming these firms are unable to fully pass through higher input costs into prices they will experience some compression in their profit margins at least in the short run thereby causing a decline in the marginal return on investment in most forms of equipment and structures7 moreover to the extent that higher oil prices are associated with greater uncertainty about the economic outlook businesses may decide to put off key investment decisions until that uncertainty subsides,1
with productivity somewhat weak unit labor costs will accelerate and at some point firms will have no choice but to start passing these price pressures onto consumers,1
why productivity matters the importance of productivity growth is easy to demonstrate,1
with the federal funds rate about as low as it can go significant further decreases in inflation as a result of the substantial slack in resources lower import prices and declines in the prices of oil and other commodities could imply an increase in the real federal funds rate,1

my forecast calls for about 3 percent growth in 2014 this is in line with the central tendency of 28 to 32 percent growth reported by my colleagues on the fomc in december 2013 there has been discussion of some recent weakness in consumer spending housing starts and housing sales,1
business investment in capital goods and plants should also post moderate gains as factories are expanded and equipment is upgraded to accommodate increased industrial production,1
growth in consumer spending slowed from its rapid pace of the late 1990s but consumer spending has not declined in any quarter of this cycle,1

central banks regularly commit to maintain low inflation in the longer term if such a promise is viewed as credible by the public then it will tend to be selffulfilling as inflation expectations will be low and households and firms will temper their demands for higher wages and prices,1
the first consumer spending is expanding,1

weak global demand has been driving energy and commodity prices lower this past year,1
that development in turn could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment and keep inflation from falling too low4 another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack,1
simplicity        there is significant justification for both higher levels and higher quality of capital,1
we also track estimates of the number of parttime workers who might convert to full time in a stronger job market,1
accordingly we cant count on the foreign sector to offset weak domestic demand for goods and services,1
the record shows that deeper and longer recessions can leave behind lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy3 avoidable household and business insolvencies can weigh on growth for years to come,1

so without robust consumer spending the economy will be sluggish,1
clearly there will be increased costs to businesses households and governments to achieve and maintain a heightened degree of security,1
the latest data suggest that consumer spending is robust and consumer confidence is high,1

commercial real estate construction will remain weak as will capital spending by businesses and personal consumption of durable goods,1
im hopeful that productivity growth will improve but in the meantime its  worth exploring how we can draw workers off the sidelines,1
according to common wisdom the midwest benefitted quite a bit from the declining dollar which made its exports cheaper for overseas buyers,1
as i noted earlier i believe the economy has already met the criteria of substantial improvement in labor market conditions and the economic outlook has improved as well,1
there is general acceptance of the goals of stabilization policy which include high employment rising output and relatively stable prices,1
evidence of recent cessation in real product growth is provided by an apparent slight decrease in real gnp for the fourth quarter of last year and a six per cent annual rate of decrease in the industrial production index since mid1969,1
it is interesting to ask for example whether consumer credit con trols might have dampened the recent consumer spending boom,1
the slowdown in europe has resulted in some cooling of overall export growth and a slowing in us manufacturing,1
on one side were those who favored a centralized institution with a strong private sector orientation preferably located in new york,1
how long can advances in technology and computer technology in particular continue to support a higher productiv ity growth rate,1
in the 1980s japan and many european countries achieved larger increases in productiv ity than the us but since the mid1990s productiv ity growth in the us has surpassed that in japan and europe,1
it was unusually well maintained during last years downtur n and on average productiv ity has increased at a robust pace over the past three quarters,1
in conclusion a too early to determine that productivity will grow at a strong pace for the longer term,1
but some larger multinational firms have become more hesitant and several manufacturing contacts have said that the tariffs have been disruptive to their supply chains forcing them to find alternative suppliers or face increasing costs of production,1
capital spending has been growing in the doubledigit range for two years now,1
but to solidify the expansion final demand needs to gain a firmer footing,1
some of the negative effect of rising oil prices has been offset by solid productivity growth and accommodative monetary policy,1
despite these worries consumer spending has held up well it grew 36 percent in 2006 which is a robust pace by historical standards,1
the low savings rate and high debt to income ratios that resulted from very high consumer spending growth will dampen these expenditures as we go forward,1
in  addition we are running up against problems of capacity constraints that i will discuss in a moment,1
in the interest of enhancing our global competitiveness  and ensuring continued improvement in living standards for coming generations congress needs to take steps now to trim spending and if that cannot be done to raise more revenues,1
our industries are geared toward large manufacturing runs that supply products to nationwide retail outlets and distributors with numerous local accounts,1
the construction industry suffers from the lingering overhang from past overbuilding and hesitancy among many lenders to finance new projects,1
the outlook for net exports remains poor due mainly to the weak economic conditions of many of our largest trading partners,1
specifically the southeast should continue to get most of its gain from business services employment,1
ive spent my professional life helping firms make decisions about hiring compensation and prices and ive made a lot of those decisions myself,1
also ive been struck by the large number of accounts ive heard recently about firms having difficulty finding workers with the appropriate skills in many cases constraining production,1
in this recovery though real consumer spending has grown at a pace that is fairly modest and not strong enough to generate the rapid overall growth we have seen in other recoveries,1
the difficulties are intensified by the strains on the financial system caused first by a significant acceleration of inflation and then by the necessary financial and nonfinancial adjustments to disinflation rhich was not fully anticipated by the markets,2
during the last 20 years or so weve deregulated financial markets weve developed more flexible labor markets and weve made major advances in technology,2
ive emphasized consequences related to financial market  instability like inflated asset prices volatile asset returns and heightened  merger activity,2
we continue to urge banks to exercise prudent lending standards especially in regard to highly leveraged firms,2
to be sure the stock prices of oldline companies          do rise somewhat through arbitrage when the market as a whole is propelled          higher by stock prices of cuttingedge technologies,2
1          economists themselves have not always fully appreciated the importance of a healthy financial system for economic growth or the role of financial conditions in shortterm economic dynamics,2
a critical part of our work since the crisis to promote a stable financial system has therefore involved greater effort to ensure that large institutions are operating safely and soundly and are prepared to continue serving households and businesses even when faced with stressful financial conditions,2
the stakes are enormous actually nothing less than the preservation of a safe and sound financial system that can continue to operate in an orderly manner when the clock rolls over at midnight on new years eve and the millennium arrives on the scene,2
but deregulation of deposit rates has enabled cotrraercial banks and savings banks to recapture some of the market share lost to the money market funds  albeit at rising costs,2
what are the main lessons to be learned on the domestic monetary side of thingsfirst of all there is the clear lesson that more needs to be done in the area of restructuring our financial system so that public policies to combat inflation can work more effectively,2
the severe financial strains of the last few weeks bring to mind two very important issues relating to the federal reserve and to both your morning and afternoon sessions,2
while the economy had been expanding strongly through the summer no one could be certain about the effect of last octobers stock market crash,2
this raises the cost of regulated intermediation however and increases the demand for liquid depositlike investment vehicles that avoid regulation,2
         in the aftermath of the financial crisis ongoing increases in capital buffers reductions in funding vulnerabilities improvements in risk management and attention to orderly resolution are producing a substantially more resilient financial system,2
there had been some fear at the time of the stock market collapse that the drop in household wealth would lead to a significant retrenchment in consumer spending,2
if the public is adversely affected how can we change the rules consistent with safe and sound banking and financial market stability,2
public policymakers charged with ensuring a safe and sound banking system should therefore exercise restraint and resist calls for premature regulation,2
if we look at another monetary variableinterest ratesrising rates may stem from either a restrictive monetary policy or increased demands for credit,2
the recognition that excessive risktaking threatens the safety net and that access to the safety net can give banks a competitive advantage over nonbank rivals led to the enactment over time of regulator restrictions on bank activities including prohibitions on some powers that banks now desire to meet changed circumstancesthe federal reserve board recognizes the importance of attaining relief from regulations adopted in an environment drastically different from that of today,2
this of course is the problem of moral hazard associated with toobigtofail perceptions whereby investors or counterparties are willing to extend credit at prices that do not fully reflect the risk associated with the bank2           the market discipline traditionally associated with the market for corporate control is also affected by banking regulation and supervision,2
during the financial crisis we used our safety and soundness authority to require banks to hold sufficient capital to weather the impact of the crisis and the serious recession that followed,2
some emerging market economies do not have the infrastructure to support a fully convertible internationally traded currency and to allow unrestricted capital flows,2
the resolution of the military conflict in iraq is now showing through to favorable financial market conditions around the world,2
reducing the extent of thrift restructuring would likewise reduce the pressures for a parallel restructuring of the banking industryeconomies of scale in commercial bankingover time the existence of economies of scale in commercial banking has probably been the most frequently cited cause of a coming restructuring of the banking industry,2
introductory remarks by thomas c melzer for session ii new instruments  new risks innovation  structural change in financial markets a conference sponsored by the federal reserve bank of new york may 46 1986 the subject of our second session is new instruments  new risks,2
litigation involving interstate nonbank operations is ongoingwould the general introduction of interstate banking produce a really major restructuring of the banking system,2
and as we expand bank powers we inevitably add new elements of risk risk which must be matched against adequate levels of capital,2
the only thing that would change is the division of the total credit demand amongst the suppliersthe introduction of now accounts and share draft accounts increased the number of competitors in the provision of third party payment services but that added competition has not been blamed for any financial institutions failure,2
the prophets of small bank doom although receiving considerable press attention have provided no evidence to support their position,2
and second some shocks to the financial system are so substantial especially when they weaken a large number of intermediaries that decreases in aggregate demand can be large long lasting and not quickly or easily remedied by conventional monetary policy,2
in addition the banking powers of the thrift institutions have been expanded by the garn st germain act and by the laws of states such as california and florida,2
the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of 1980 federal reserve bulletin vol,2
the banks under 25 million of assets had a higher return on assets 156 than the banks with assets over 250 million 108,2
we cannot forever rely upon consumers even though their confidence is at a fiveyear highthus the question in the minds of many forecasters today is whether this cyclical recoveryexpansion will abort from increasing interest rates and the collision of federal megadeficit spending with rising private credit demands,2
as an exairple in 1978 congress lowered the capital gains rates thus stimulating venture capital expansion that bodes well for continued investment in new innovations and technologiesin addition as evidenced in the deregulation of the financial industry there are other changes to our business structure that have been encouraged by increased competition and innovation and that hold the promise of increasing efficiency and productivity of course in the case of the deregulation of the financial industry seme of these changes have had the immediate impact of complicating the process of monetary policy and in the broader sense the implementation for public policy in the recovery period,2
although i am a firm believer in deregulation in financial services i believe that this barrier is one that needs to be kept in good repair in view of the critical role of finance in the functioning o f any economy and the special safety net that has been constructed over the years for various segments o f the financial services industry because of this key economic role,2
the most serious problem is the increased risk of the residual loan portfolio the portfolio that has been effectively stripped of its high quality assets for which regulatory capital exceeds economic capital,2
perhaps under basel ii bankers and regulators will build the true relationship of trust and understanding that did not emerge under basel i as a central bank responsible for the financial integrity of the financial system the federal reserve sees the development of adequate risk management systems as an important part of its balanced approach to bank supervision,2
but the depth of the depression in germany exceeded that even of the united states and the failure in 1931 of a large austrian bank credit anstalt was an important trigger of a wave of bank failures that affected many countries including the united states,2
to give this assurance to banks the federal reserve has made clear that it will provide shortterm credit to sound financial institutions as needed,2
in practice the difficulty has been that in the united states deregulation financial innovation and other factors have led to recurrent instability in the relationships between various monetary aggregates and other nominal variables,2
well the history of loan losses as well asset quality problems suggest that ci loans are risky assets,2
accordingly we are now seriously considering making some targeted adjustments to our existing regulatory capital rules and looking for ways to enhance their risk sensitivity without increasing regulatory burden,2
lets look at some of  first central banks throughout the world share a  common concern for systemic risk in financial markets,2
we also want bankers to actively manage concentrations of credit risk and be mindful that strong lending activity can strain liquidity,2
the special marginal reserve requirement on increases in managed liabilities of larger banks was decided upon in view of the fact that those sources of funds have financed much of the recent buildup in bank creditthe experience of recent weeks has been hopeful but the new technique for conducting open market operations will not be a panaceaover the longer run the principal effect will occur through the impact of the new procedures on inflation,2
for example tier 1 common equity capital ratios at the largest us banks have nearly doubled since 20079 in addition new requirements address the specific interactions that banks have with ccps and derivatives markets in order to promote both the use of central clearing and strong ccp risk management,2
philosophically i think we would very much like to deregulate the depository institutions but the fact of the matter is the thrift industry cant stand it at this point in time,2
moreover it is difficult for supervisors and examiners to monitor and assess the interestrate risk exposure of a financial institution,2
but the record of the past 30 years does indicate that banks have done quite w0ll in a world of rapid financial innovation increasing competition and advancing technology,2
similarly the rise in stock prices which reduces corporate contributions to pension funds is also augmenting reported profits,2
the role o f the federal reserve in the  e x p e c te i t h u rsd a y  payments mechanism  statement o f e gerald corrigan president federal reserve     statement of e gerald corrigan president federal reserve bank of minneapolis minneapolis minnesota before the subcommittee on domestic monetary policy of the committee on banking finance and urban affairs and the subcommittee on commerce consumer and monetary affairs of the committee on government operations us house of representatives june 16 1983  mr chairmen i greatly appreciate the opportunity to appear before these subcommittees to review developments with regard to the pricing of services by the federal reserve under the monetary control act mca of 1980 and to comment on some larger issues regarding the role of the federal reserve in the payments mechanism,2
the major objectives of basel ii include creating a better link between minimum regulatory capital and risk enhancing market discipline supporting a level playing field in an increasingly integrated global financial system establishing and maintaining a minimum capital cushion sufficient to foster financial stability in periods of adversity and uncertainty and grounding risk measurement and management in actual data and formal quantitative techniques,2
thats not to say that we prevent commercial banks from failingwe do not provide institutions with capital and if the corrective actions are unsuccessful the bank could fail,2
the unusual severity of the recession and ongoing strains in financial markets made the challenges facing monetary policymakers all the greater,2
beyond the regional interstate compacts interstate expansion is currently limited to acquisitions of failing banks by strong outofstate banks,2
the fomc knew that tools were available to choke off the stock market boom but those tools would only have been effective if they undermined market participants confidence in future stability,2
redesigning financial system regulation speech given at the new york university conference on restoring financial stability how to repair a failed system new york march 6 2009 plosser charles,2
the recent enactment of the grammleachbliley glb financial modernization act of 1999 is one of the most important steps in this history but it is best understood as part of this historical continuum of regulatory change south of your border,2
but it will not continue unless each of these  men contributes fully to sound banking practices and supports constructive management,2
but when holding companies borrow to help finance their acquisition of bank stock the question of double leverage and the degree to which it should be permitted arises,2
this is in contrast to the situation prevailing in other countries where nationwide banking has increased the safety and soundness of the financial structure through diversification,2
it would also promulgate all regulations excluding those dealing with monetary policy which are now required or authorized to be issued by any of the three supervisory agencies and it would otherwise administer and interpret the federal banking lawsthe new commission has been pictured as being almost exclusively concerned with quasijudicial functions calling for a high degree of knowledge of the banking industry as well as the ability to analyze both facts and law,2
by reducing the cost of substitution among the various investment instruments the trend toward securitization may well have contributed to increased volatility of financial markets,2
presumably one o f the  primary motivations for integrating financial markets here is to keep pace with the exchange of goods in the common market,2
laws were enacted to separate commercial banking from investment banking,2
i also expect that real financial reform legislation will pass and banks insurance companies and securities firms will be allowed to affiliate to provide integrated financial services to individuals and businesses at less cost,2
for the most part consolidation and integration of the banking system have been driven by similar economic motivations and the policy responses are based on the same principles,2
commercial banks had become a major factor in home finance and the uneconomically low rates on mortgages made the thrifts with most of their eggs in one basket especially vulnerable to deregulation of deposit interest rates,2
a few examples insured depositors have not lost their funds in spite of mme than 100 commercial bank failures a year in recent times,2
this issue will inevitably emerge as part of the debate over further expansion of bank powers,2
however it is important that lending practices do not raise the risk profile of banking organizations or weaken the financial system,2
4as we move to reconstitute or assimilate the troubled institutions in the thrift industry and rehabilitate the great texas banking companies and as banks absorb additional provisions to bring third world debt reserves to more realistic levels and recognize mounting losses in commercial real estate the demands of banking on the capital markets will be huge,2
a stunning example is campeau where cash flows apparently failed to materialize as projected and a seemingly perfect deal ended in the bankruptcy court with unsettling effects on financial markets,2
functional regulation of nonbanking activities would assure expert oversight for each activity and the integrated marketing of related financial services provided by multiple entities would significantly enhance competitiveness,2
by the mid1990s we will have de facto nationwide interstate banking without the de jure blessing of congress or repeal of the mcfadden act,2
consider for a moment some of the nightmare problems the manager of a bank holding company faces with banks in ten different states,2
according to data collected under the home mortgage disclosure act hmda mortgage originations for secondhome purchases rose from 7 percent of total purchase originations in 2000 to twice that at the end of last year,2
these burdens are the result of wellintended legislation drafted without a full appreciation of the cost to banks of additional reporting and complianceit is also fairly obvious to me that the american ethic of shortterm profits and matching shortterm strategies puts american banks and financial institutions at a great disadvantage,2
foreign competitors at least take a longer view which is condoned and rewarded by their capital marketsforgoing shortterm profits to gain market share by bidding deals at skinny profit margins is considered smart in many countriesin the united states such behavior is punished with lower stock prices and higher interest costs for borrowed capitalwell i wont bore you with further description of a situation of which you are all too well aware,2
the  willingness of most members in congress to deal with glass steagall reform was clearly demonstrated by the overwhelming senate vote for senator proxmires bill in 1988 in my opinion that legislation would have passed the house in similar fashion if it had reached the floor,2
deposit insurance originally designed to avoid financial panics and runs on solvent banks has worked too well,2
recognizing the increased ability of thrifts to compete with commercial banks as well as the need of all institutions to compete with the rates available on market instruments there has been a narrowing over time in the differential between the rate ceilings on deposits among the various types of institutions,2
an argument frequently used against spreading the net any wider that is to say granting additional powers to federally  insured banks is that the safety net provides a subsidy to banks,2
thus we were able to conduct this analysis purely internally without putting additional burdens on banks during an alreadydifficult time,2
this would include thorough asset quality examinations at least once a year and more often in the case of banks with problems second higher capital requirements for banks which want to expand rapidly enter new businesses ge novo or pursue aggressive acquisition programs,2
the boards testimony presented at a senate hearing in may supported full disclosure of credit terms and indicated that the burden on financial institutions for disclosure requirements as to solicitations by mail would not be substantialwe did note however that the need for increased disclosures is by no means certain and further that requiring the inclusion of disclosures on all applications  not just mail solicitations  could be both burdensome and costly to a degree that would exceed consumer benefits,2

the period of relative legal and industry stability that followed the new deal legislation thus gave way in the 1970s to a nearly 30year period during which many prevailing restrictions on banks were relaxed both through administrative action by the bank regulatory agencies and through a series of legislative changes culminating in the grammleachbliley act of 1999 by the turn of the century the depressionera cluster of restrictions on commercial banks had been replaced by a regulatory environment in which they could operate nationally conduct a much broader range of activities and affiliate with virtually any kind of financial firm,2
later in my remarks i will also touch on the foreign bank supervision enhancement act fbsea which i am sure weighs on the minds of many here,2
financial markets have improved some since last fall though they remain disrupted and fragile,2
legislative proposals to remove the grammleachbliley constraints placed on the federal reserves ability to obtain information from and address unsafe and unsound practices in the subsidiaries of bank holding companies would make this supervisory reorientation more effective,2
because of perceived weakness in the banking system scandals involving bcci and salomon brothers and intense lobbying by various special interest groups congress focused on refinancing the bank insurance fund and tightening regulatory restraints,2
an increase in the business that banks do with highly leveraged investors like some hedge funds leads to an increase in the attention that banks must pay to counterparty risk management,2
over the course of this year commercial banks have tightened their lending standards and quality spreads have increased in the bond marketespecially in the highyield sector,2
it is now 214 per cent as compared with the 312 per cent rate set last summer after commercid173cial banks responding to strong loan demands had moved their prime rate up to 4 l2 per cent,2
if we look at some major pieces of banking legislation such as the expedited funds availability act and the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia can see that these laws are so detailed as to leave very little we flexibility for either regulators or banks,2
that statement was originally issued in 1980 to facilitate the transfer of ownership of small communitybased banks in a safe and sound manner,2
unfortunately some managers might use fewer credit derivatives to reduce credit risk due to this potential earnings volatility,2
the regulatory burden on banks is not the only element of social cost but it is an important component,2
it is charged with ensuring the integrity of the payments system and it is a participant in its evolution,2
we also monitor the state of the financial industry as a whole and work with other federal and state financial authorities to help maintain stability in the financial sector,2
more recently the pricing of loansnot just the availability of loanshas been a potential source of discriminatory lending practices,2
in the rest of my remarks i will elaborate on these points though not in the spirit of a debaters arguments but in an effort to answer the question i posed a moment ago how that is can we successfully reduce the risks to financial stability posed by large internationally active banks,2
solving the immediate problem of weak asset quality and improving the industryU0092s overall profitability was of course the first priority and fortunately that was accomplished sooner than anyone expected,2
it has given banks greater flexibility in managing balancesheet items against riskbased capital standards while at the same time increasing fee income by continuing to service the collection of interest and principal for the investor,2
in a break with tradition we had to provide that liquidity to nonbank financial institutions as well as to banks,2
many thrift institutions which used to be geographically constrained to single states like banks are expanding interstate by the acquisition of financially distressed thrift institutions,2
such charges would be designed to reduce the burden on banks of membershipin the federal reserve systemif this move toward explicit pricing does eventuate the banking industry in general must be aware of what it costs to offer specific services to the public,2
but it was against the backdrop of the need for massive taxpayerbacked assistanceto firms and to markets more generallythat congress and financial regulators developed responses to the woefully inadequate capital levels of prudentially regulated firms the systemic consequences of stress at previously nonprudentially regulated firms such as the freestanding investment banks the widespread failures of risk management within these firms the parallel failures in supervision of these firms and the fragility of a financial system that had become characterized by large amounts of runnable shortterm funding,2

though inflation is hardly a rare economic malady doing something about it still involves overcoming complex and intractible political obstacles and avoiding excessive strains on financial institutions and creditwlnerable sectors of the economy,2
the supervisory organizations have agreed that basel i with its broadbrush system for setting the risk weights on various classes of bank assets is increasingly inadequate for measuring risk and the appropriate level of capital for such firms,2
the fdic may consider systemic concerns in a failing banks resolution and has the authority to act as a receiver for a failed commercial bank and run a bridge bank for up to five years,2
and our financial markets now react to japanese and gennan 110netary and fiscal policy decisions as well as to such policy decisions tn the us  these changes and the associated worldwide integration of capital markets has effectively encouraged significantly more competition from various foreign banks and financial institutions,2
interstate bunking in their view would favor large institutions at the expense of smaller ones and lead ultimately to a potentially dangerous concentration of financial power and to the demise of many valuable community banks,2
because shortterm interest rates were rising the previous ceiling on these deposits of 412 per cent established in november 1964 had placed banks at a competitive disadvantage with rates on other forms of financial assets and if left unchanged could have resulted in distortions in the flow of funds at a time of seasonally strong credit demands,2
similarly credit evaluations tend to be more costly for lowerincome borrowers who are relatively more likely to have short or irregular credit histories5 informational barriers to lending were heightened by the absence of uniform national depositories of information on the credit experiences of consumers at the time the creditreporting system consisted of hundreds of local credit bureaus each of which maintained limited information on local residents6 the high costs of gathering information together with the difficulty of keeping information proprietary may have created a firstmover problem in which each financial institution has an incentive to let one of its competitors be the first to enter an underserved market,2
a third important issue has been raised by the greatly increased foreign operations of us banks seen in the rise of their foreign branch assets from 5 billion in 1962 to 80 billion in 1973 as chairman burns has noted overseas expansion has been a major component of the upsurge in assets that has called for commensurate increases in bank capital,2
although rooted in the declining profitability of farm production and land speculation the accumulated burden of farm debt could pose some threat to the functioning of the banking system,2
only last october chairman burns noted that in recent times american banking has gone through a profound evolution that has multiplied bankings exposure to the dangers inherent in excessive leveraging reliance on volatile deposits heavy loan commitments relative to resources rapid expansion of bank holding companies into diversified holdings and increased foreign exchange risks,2
michael moskow speeches  1999  39  o as a result the federal open market committee took action last fall to cushion prospective us economic growth from the effects of increasing weakness overseas and unsettled financial markets at home,2
moreover i am also convinced that a drastic increase in bank credit geared to exports would produce little in the way of additional export shipments while adding greatly to capital outflow,2
crosscurrents from policy uncertainty have risen since early may crimping business investment plans raising concerns in some financial market segments and weighing on global growth prospects,2
in a banking system with well over 14 000 banks it should be expected that s o m e institutions would b e c o m e overextended and experience larger than average loan losses,2
as many of you are aware the federal banking agencies through the interagency country risk exposure review committee icerc are developing an improved guide for examiners in evaluating the countryrisk exposure in banks,2
firstquarter data showed that aggregate capital ratios increased and banks continued to maintain ample levels of liquidity,2
most of the expansion in bank credit during recessions and early recoveries has taken the form of net acquisitions of securities,2
eere the monetary influence is traced directly in the flow of bank credit to consumers government and businesses and indirectly in the impact of bank credit expansion on interest rates and other borrowing terms,2
the ensuing wider intereptrate fluctuations would then have had the effects i have already sketched  stronger and quicker impact on the real sector wider exchange rate fluctuations probably sce damage to the financial systemthe experieoee of this year supports the view that the causal relationsuip of monetarypolicy action runs from the money supply to interest rates to the economy,2
in the early phase of the present recovery the slow growth of bank loans to business might have signaled to some that monetary policy was too restrictive while to others it seemed a signal of high business liquidity and ample availability of funds from internal sourcesdigitized for fraser httpfraserstlouisfedorg federal reserve bank of st louis another problem in policymaking is that many of the economic facts needed for policy formation are frequently unavailable or become available so late as to be of little use in current policy formation,2
of course when property values rise and the loan business grows increasingly competitive bank supervisors tend to worry that moreaggressive underwriting may set the stage for future deterioration in credit quality,2
the implications for financial stability from the recent market turmoilthe changing business of the largest commercial banks means that threats to financial stability do not necessarily come from traditional sources such as a deposit run or a deterioration in a banks portfolio of business loans,2
individuals decide to channel their new flows of savings into higher yielding market securities,2
and this is particularly true for highly concentrated agricultural banks where maintaining enhanced agricultural credit riskmanagement practices to facilitate prudent underwriting early detection of problems and wellthoughtout restructuring plans for agricultural borrowers are imperative to limiting losses and maintaining a sound banking institution,2
nevertheless though the effects of these excesses are likely to continue for much of this year in the form of moderately deteriorating asset quality and earnings at some of the larger banks these problems one hopes will prove modest both by historical standards and relative to the resources of these institutions,2
it has affected the ability of banks to attract and retain deposits it has complicated the making and collecting of loans and it has had an adverse effect on bank profits,2
can occur only if the federal reserve supplies additional reserves to the banking system either through its open market operations or through a reduction in reserve requirements,2
by the late 1990s outlays declined to under 19 percent of gdp primarily as a result of significant reductions in defense spending relative to gdp while revenues boosted especially by a strong economy and a strong stock market rose to a high of nearly 21 percent of gdp thus yielding surpluses,2
this connection between economic health and the banking system as you know is what persuaded congress to assign to the federal reserve an important role in supervising the safety and soundness of banking organizations as well as the responsibility for the discount window,2
through stress testing and other improvements to supervision the federal reserve is requiring more of large institutions,2
third attention should be given to improvement in the mechanism for assuring a sound payments system and appropriate financial liquidity,2
so while some policies that carefully target truly abusive practices are warranted the broader risk is of a regulatory overreaction that stifles much of the benefit of the technologydriven expansion in consumer credit,2
the reduced credit demands from balancing the budget are significant,2
free and open trade for instance depends on a strong banking systemnot only in the united states but also in each of our trading partners,2
either way they imply for the government a huge potential liability in the event of widespread bank failure,2
because the ability of the here tofore specialized thrift institutions to com  pete against banks would likely be increased if their lending and fundraising powers were broadened and m ade m ore com parable to those of com m ercial banks but if their tax burdens reserve requirem ents and regulatory structure were not,2
a predominance of private monies may introduce consumer protection and financial stability risks because of their potential volatility and the risk of runlike behavior,2
in so doing they can lean against vulnerabilities in the financial system that encourage the growth of excess credit,2
the incremental changes i am considering to increase transparency accountability and fairness would make supervision more efficient and effective and our financial system stronger and more stable,2
these changes include the consolidation and increased geographic scope of the banking industry a blurring of the distinctions between various financial institutions deregulation and the implementation of financial strategies made possible by improvements in computer technology and advances in finance theory,2
so far as i am aware the experience and performance of banks in these conglomerates has not been intensively studied from the standpoint of implication of such linkages for public policy objectivesfrom the beginning the boards position has been that the prohibitions in the bank holding company act against bank holding companies engaging in nonbanking activities should apply to onebank holding companies,2
as it turned out banks were in pretty good shape and weathered the spring of 2020 pretty well after a decade of effort by them and by government to strengthen regulation and supervision4 on the other hand probably the last thing that we expected to see was severe stress in the treasury market the most liquid and stable financial market in the world,2
excessive asset price inflation raises concerns about financial stability,2
the interagency guidance stressed the importance of continuing to make prudent loans to creditworthy customers1 clarified standards for commercial real estate cre loans and workouts2 and most recently restated supervisory views on lending to small businesses3           at the federal reserve we have complemented the guidance with training programs for examiners and outreach to the banking industry that underscores the importance of sound lending practices,2
three states iowa nebraska and wisconsin have followed federal legislation has been introduced but it seems obvious  that the vitality of our state banking system will be better safeguarded by corrective legislation at the state level,2
they have faced weak sales diminished asset values elevated uncertainty and tight credit market conditions,2
while total bank credit expanded at an annual rate of about 9 per cent during the first eight months of 1966 business loans rose at an annual rate of 20 per cent in the same period,2
since the recession low stock prices have risen persistently while bond prices have fallen to levels comparable to those at the crest of the last cycle,2
bank credit measured by loans and investments of commercial banks expanded by 12 per cent,2
mortgage debt consumer debt and business borrowing all rose rapidly as did borrowing by state and local governments superimposed on these heavy credit demands was record borrowing for peacetime by the federal government after the 1958 recession was over,2
what has happened to loan quality in the rush to put additional amounts of higher yielding assets on the books,2
banks have been under growing competitive pressure not only from other banking institutions but from thrift institutions insurance companies diversified financial corporations of various kinds and from nonfinancial firms that extend consumer credit,2
the financial outlook is for a gradual increase in the credit demands of the private sector,2
the federal reserve as the supervisor of state member banks and bank and financial holding companies has been working with other regulators and financial institutions to improve the effectiveness and relevance of regulation and supervision in this changing environment,2
market participants also establish credit limits for their counterparties and actively monitor their exposures to ensure that they remain within the limits established,2
moreover a strong capital base significantly reduces the moral hazard risks associated with the extension of the federal safety net,2
if we persist in bailing out all creditors thougheven those of the holding company then none of the proposals for increased market discipline has much chance of success,2
for example deregulation has allowed banks to expand their geographic reach facilitating the formation of a number of large geographically diversified banking organizations,2
in addition the federal reserve contributes to the development of policies regarding banking supervision and regulation collaborating with the other agencies to issue rules and guidance that help ensure that federally supervised banking entities are adhering to the high prudential standards that are essential to maintain a stable banking system,2
operating subsidiary failures will continue to be treated either under bankruptcy or where applicable under specialized resolution schemes including the federal deposit insurance act for banks and the securities investor protection act for securities firms,2
these large business demands for external funds were reflected in both capital market financing and loan expansion at commercial banks,2
life insurance  companies for example had 4 per cent more assets in october 1960 than in december 1959  although the total of bank deposits and currency seasonally  adjusted in the nation is below that of a year ago it has been rising recently and bank credit has increased,2
individual borrowers it is true have been finding funds increasingly more difficult and more costly to obtain as demands for credit have been rising even more rapidly than the     10increasing supplies,2
the federal reserve for its part raised reserve requirements on time deposits to add a marginal cost and reserve restraint on bank issuance of cds and amended regulation q several times to hold down permissible rates payable by commercialdigitized for fraser httpfraserstlouisfedorg federal reserve bank of st louis7 the consequences ho1ever uere sherp shrinkages in new savings inflous to these institutions and resultini drastic cutbacks in new lending to their chief customer the housing market,2
in 1959 for example when high yields on marketable securities were also cutting heavily into the share of total savings going to depositarycid173type institutions commercial banks had less interest rate leeway to compete and the lions share of the shrinkage in flows occurred at banks,2
restrictive monetary policies prevailed only  during the last three quarters of 1966 and a few weeks in early 1967 in response to recent economic developments the federal  reserve has raised the discount rate and increased reserve require ments pointing to less expansive monetary policies,2
these provisions collectively often called the bank safety net were designed to minimize the potential for asset or other problems in the banking system to disrupt the real economy but as an unavoidable byproduct also provide an important subsidy to banks,2
16 in closing i realize that i have offered nothing new or unusual in the way of suggestions as to how banks can meet the credit needs of modern agriculture,2
as usual my remarks reflect only my own views and are not intended to reflect those of the federal open market committee fomc or of anyone else associated with the federal reserve system2  supporting market liquidity as i pointed out in a speech last october one of the fundamental reasons that the federal reserve was established in 1913 was to ensure the provision of ample liquidity during financial market disruptions mishkin 2007a,2
the sharp rise in stock market activity which has also brought noticeable processing delays could have added further to the demand for cash balances,2
in light of early experience with this innovative statutory regime the board in 1984 mandated that each reserve bank appoint a community affairs officer to help financial institutions understand the laws requirements,2
more  6  the banker am the county agent  this increased cooperation between banks in meeting the needs of the farmer is becoming more evident every day,2
digitized for fraser httpfraserstlouisfedorg federal reserve bank of st louis2by the end of september had reduced their foreign claims by over 700 million below the amount outcid173standing at the end of last december or by 300 million more than had been requested for all of 1968 during the last 312 years there has been a noticeable shift of bank funds to the developing countries which has been matched almost entirely by a decline of bank lending in continental western europe,2
something like this probably occurred in 1971 for the first half of the year real economic activity and price anticipations constituted sufficiently strong demand for credit to offset the rapidly expanding money supply and thereby foster rising interest rates,2
in these circumstances rising credit demand is naturally reflected in an increase in corporate borrowing costs and that has indeed been our recent experience especially in longerdated issues,2
cybersecurity is an important part of financial stability it would be difficult to determine the level of safety and soundness of an individual bank or of the financial system overall without paying attention to the risks to cybersecurity,2
even where direct losses to other banks were thought manageable the failure of a large bank might strike panic into depositors especially uninsured depositors of other large institutions,2
together with reform of our financial system for the more efficient marshalling of credit we must in parallel adopt measures to avoid waste of human talent and energy unemployment and to avoid the waste of scarce capital by making a scapegoat of any economic sector such as housing and the mortgage market,2
community banks and regulatory reform        as you know a key challenge for community banks in the years ahead will be to adapt to the changing regulatory environment particularly the regulatory reforms contained in the doddfrank act as well as the changes that will be associated with the basel iii reforms,2
financial sector weaknesses rigid exchange rate regimes and volatile capital flows combined to yield a highly combustible mixture that with the spark of adverse external shocks ignited currency and debt crises including the collapse of banking systems throughout the region     the asian crisis experience highlights the crucial importance of robust institutions and sound policies in mitigating the risks emanating from external financial shocks,2

banks and thrift institutions that hold mortgages are wellcapitalized and exposures of individual banks to possible subprime losses do not appear to be large,2
although it has taken time globalization is helping to generate the demand for an improved financial system which is driving the reform process,2
to the extent that these measures improve market functioning they will have favorable effects on the availability of credit to the broader economy,2
as is well known bond prices have risen substantially rather than tending downward as had been widely anticipated last fall and stock prices have fallen dramatically,2
but  the upsurge in inflation has also gone hand in hand with the excessive money growth of past years when monetary policy was pushed off course by the ex cessive credit demands generated primarily by federal deficit financing,2
in his july 2019 testimony to the house financial services committee fed chair powell highlighted our concerns about libra particularly around consumer privacy and protection the risks of money laundering and the need to assess its impact on broader financial stability7 with this increase in unfavorable regulatory and congressional attention the libra associationthe group founded to fund libra and provide oversight over ithas seen an exodus of original founding partners including paypal visa and mastercard,2
according to the 2007 survey of consumer finances scf home equity accounted for about half of the total net worth for low and moderateincome families which made them extremely vulnerable to the eventual housing market collapse10 families at the lower end of the income distribution saw a substantial drop in their net worth between 2007 and 2009 and families in the middle of the income distribution fared even worse11 combined with widespread unemployment housing and stock price declines and increasing rates of mortgage defaults foreclosures and bankruptcies the assets of many american families have been significantly eroded,2
these are believed to have stimulative or contractive effects on economic activity through some mechanism which though imperfectly observed is nonetheless believed to be operative though with variable lagssome analysts prefer to examine monetary behavior in the prenatal period that is by focusing on the creation of reserves that in turn leads the banking system to expand its assets in a way that4digitized for fraser httpfraserstlouisfedorg federal reserve bank of st louis4i have another bone to pick with the particular time spans chosen for analysis,2
as investors and creditors lost confidence in the ability of certain firms to meet their obligations their access to capital markets as well as to shortterm funding markets became increasingly impaired and their stock prices fell sharply,2
the examination which embraces every activity found in the bank has three immediate and primary purposes 1 to determine whether the banks assets are intact are worth their book value and afford anple liquidity for the volume and type of deposits 2 to detect violations of law or regulations and 3 to discover whether the bank is being operated in accordance with sound banking principles,2
the first is broadly appreciated by being clear about their objectives central banks are better able to achieve those objectives,2
reserve banks also foster a sound and efficient banking system by providing innovative and lowcost services to commercial banks,2
suppose instead we attack the problem by imposing capital requirements that are an increasing function of bank size,2
there was also growing evidence that heavy demands for credit were likely to be with us for some time to come,2
for example if the loss to the financial system from the failure of a sifi would be five times that resulting from failure of the nonsystemic firm then the sifi would have to hold additional capital sufficient to make the expected probability of failure onefifth that of the nonsifi,2
but it has been a formidable episode of financial turbulence that has revealed major weaknesses in our financial system including the business practices of many banks,2
in these circumstances measures to address financial market problems within each country are likely to be more effective if other countries are also taking similar steps as they are doing not only in monetary policy but also in their efforts to recapitalize banks guarantee bank obligations and shore up the confidence of lenders,2
the action was not a monetary policy action in the conventional sense but a response to the physical disruption of the payments system,2
banks that hold both a debt and equity stake in a firm would probably be better able to deter excessive risk taking by the other equity holders and might even have access to better information about the firm,2
we then put in place a regulatory and supervisory framework to counter these moral hazard incentives,2
according to the impact study this revision reduced the estimated global liquidity requirement from roughly 23 trillion to 900 billion14 the result is a margin regime that will protect the financial system from the largest and most systemic exposures while also reducing overall liquidity costs and providing relief to smaller derivatives market participants,2
banking organizations that do not meet one of the criteria would not be subject to a market risk capital charge regardless of whether they apply the basel i or basel ii rules for credit and operational risk,2
conflicting interests of banks and other shareholders might also be manifested through banks encouraging firms to take on more debt to pay higher interest rates on their debt or to undertake lessrisky projects than would be optimal from the point of view of shareholders,2
we should strive for a financial system that is robust to large shocks and to the unavoidable errors of judgment made by individuals or single organizations,2
establishing a coherent and stable financial regulatory regime will require rolling back expectations about how the policymakers will respond to the next financial market disturbance or the next recession,2
the key in designing approaches to enhance market discipline is therefore to ensure a favorable tradeoffsufficiently better controlled risktaking in good times and bad times relative to somewhat aggravated risks during periods of overall stress,2
but policymakers should recognize that financial market turmoil is not a gardenvariety shock to output,2
at various times we learned that a financial market was strained stressed under liquidity pressures dysfunctional frozen clogged or had seized up,2
first we have eased monetary policy substantially and proactively to address the sharp deterioration in financial conditions and to forestall some of the potential adverse effects on the broader economy,2
similarly this approach would not impose a cap on intragroup flows thereby allowing foreign banks in sound financial condition to continue to obtain us dollar funding for their global operations through their us entities,2
freeing banks to compete fairly with other financial institutions is good not just for banks but also for businesses and consumersin fact for the economy as a whole,2
the second of davids open issueswhether central banks should lean against possible asset price bubbleswas the key topic in my discussion here eighteen months ago at otmars festschrift,2
many economies have become more resilient and more capable of withstanding          shocks but financial markets themselves seem to have become more sensitive          to realtime data,2
while mechanisms already exist to address large banking failures we also need an effective process to resolve failing nonbank institutions that limits market disruption and minimize moral hazard,2
to minimize moral hazard concerns the federal reserve believes it essential that the regulatory regime for these institutions include strong prudential requirements for credit and liquidity risk management robust liquidity buffers the maintenance of adequate amounts of highquality collateral and effective memberdefault procedures,2
our hope is that the guidance we offer on these various topics is becoming more consistent with financial institutions own riskmanagement practices,2
clearly in this situation financial markets and the feds focus on our dual mandate responsibilities would ultimately lead to more restrictive financial conditions,2
working through supervisory channels has the advantage not only of helping make financial institutions better able to cope with possible asset price declines but possibly also of indirectly restraining extreme asset prices if they have been stimulated by excessive bank financing,2
the result was a hoarding of capital and liquidity a sharp increase in risk premiums and a generalized flight to liquidity and safety that only gathered momentum as instabilities in the economy and financial markets fed off each other,2
for instance the boards advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr on insurance capital requirements set out two frameworks for capital standards that are each unlike the boards capital rules for bank holding companies8 the bba as set out in the anpr was fashioned as a framework that builds upon the regulatory capital rules of subsidiaries functional regulatorsstate or foreign insurance regulators for insurance subsidiaries and federal banking regulators for insured depository institutionsto provide a consolidated capital requirement,2
first how skewed is the distribution of gains from the stock market,2
while this new framework has the same goal as the previous comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar frameworkâU0080U0094using forwardlooking analysis to help ensure that banks have sufficient capital to survive a severe recession while still being able to lend to businesses and householdâU0080U0094it integrates our stress testing regime with our ongoing capital requirements so that large banks now have a single suite of dynamic and risksensitive capital requirements,2
in the past at this conference we have evaluated how changes in technology deregulation and increased competition have affected the activities of banks and the banking industry,2
there was concern that the turbulence in the financial markets could slow economic activity in coming months,2
during the past two years we have been concerned at various stages by the possible negative effects on the us economy of the greek debt crisis by the 20 percent appreciation of the tradeweighted dollar by the chinese growth slowdown and accompanying exchange rate uncertainties by the financial market turbulence during the first six weeks of this year by the dismaying pothole in job growth this may and by brexitamong other shocks,2
to the extent that recent financial market turbulence signals an increased chance of a further slowing of growth abroad oil prices could resume falling and the dollar could start rising again,2
third a healthy banking system is an integral part of participation in the modern financial environment and also is a particularly important buffer against future financial shocks both domestic and external,2
at the january fomc meeting with our current projections for economic activity and inflation in mind the committee decided that more accommodative financial conditions would be appropriate to help bring both inflation and unemployment back over time to levels viewed as consistent with the fomcs longerrun objectives mandated by the congress,2
as i will discuss later this episode underscores the important connection for banks between capital adequacy and liquidity particularly in times of financial market stress,2
from my point of view as a central banker the key to continued longterm stable growth in latin america and the caribbeanin addition to the macroeconomic policies that have already been put in place depends on having a strong financial system in place in each country,2
the united states has experienced periodic episodes of financial system stress followed by curative adjustment and reform,2
because the failure of or loss of confidence in a major clearinghouse would create enormous uncertainty about the status of initiated transactions and consequently about the financial positions of clearinghouse participants and their customers strong risk management at these organizations as well as effective prudential oversight is essential,2
the real estate settlement procedures act respa prohibits lenders from paying fees to brokers that are not reasonably related to the value of services performed by the broker,2
in fact although no bull market goes on forever historically it has by no means been the case that strong bull markets are inevitably followed by raging bears8   further the fact that a particular rise in asset prices happens to be followed by a price decline does not prove that the initial increase was irrational or unjustifiedsometimes strategies that are perfectly reasonable ex ante just dont pan out as every bridge player knows,2
as the ssg report indicates some firms had a poor understanding of the risks inherent in certain complex products or failed to recognize that certain activities contained latent risks that could be manifest in unexpected concentrations of risk exposures when market turbulence arose,2
even in the absence of any firm that may individually seem too big or too interconnected to be allowed to fail the financial system can be vulnerable to contagion,2
market discipline can improve financial stability by aligning risks and rewards more closely,2
discretion in lending practices runs the risk of exacerbating moral hazard and encouraging financial institutions to take excessive amounts of risk,2
specifically growth appeared likely to slow significantly in the fourth quarter from its rapid thirdquarter rate and to remain sluggish in early 2008 the committee expected that economic growth would thereafter gradually return to a pace approaching its longrun trend as the drag from housing subsided and financial conditions improved,2
consequently the second component of the federal reserves strategy has been to support the functioning of credit markets and to reduce financial strains by providing liquidity to the private sectorthat is by lending cash or its equivalent secured with relatively illiquid assets,2
but we have seen similar periods of volatility in recent yearsincluding in the second half of 2011that have left little visible imprint on the economy and it is still early to judge the ramifications of the increased market volatility of the first seven weeks of 2016 as chair yellen said in her testimony to the congress two weeks ago while global financial developments could produce a slowing in the economy i think we want to be careful not to jump to a premature conclusion about what is in store for the us,2
banks also hold capital above regulatory minimums to support their strategic objectives,2
and we need to continue to work with banks to improve their riskmanagement and creditevaluation systems so that the banks are not vulnerable to unexpected movements in interest rates or asset prices in the future,2
because the real economy is more stable on average not only will the cyclical variability in the yield curve decline but the risk premium will also decline further limiting the overall premium built in to long rates,2
during recent decades unsustainable increases in asset prices have been associated on a number of occasions with botched financial liberalization in both emergingmarket and industrialized countries,2
these include accommodative monetary policy household balance sheets that have improved greatly since the recession continued progress in the labor market a more resilient banking system and low oil prices,2
instead we should think about whether or not particular financial innovations are improving peoples wellbeing,2
we need only look to the performance of community banks during the financial crisis to see how well they leverage this local knowledge and their relationships to make lending decisions,2
a second priority for bank supervisors is to continue to develop procedures that make sure no bank is too big to fail in these senses that stockholders can lose all that existing management can be replaced that uninsured creditors can suffer losses and that the institution can be wound down and possibly sold in whole or in part in an orderly way,2
the linkage of much slower price increases and bank failures is most apparent among farm banks which have seen crop prices and incomes of their customers decline while the value of farm land dipped as much as 50 percent in some areas,2
in my example the airline could buy a forward contract or a call option on jet fuel to hedge its risk and thereby increase its financial stability,2
although we have seen signs of improvement financial market functioning remains impaired in many ways and we will need to continue to consider whether additional steps are needed to reopen credit flows and support the economy,2
for example movements in collateral values can trigger margin calls and fire sales of assets and thus activities that depend on marketvalued collateral can be vulnerable,2
for example some observers have raised concerns that by driving longerterm yields lower nontraditional policies could induce an imprudent reach for yield by some investors and thereby threaten financial stability,2
of course banks are being careful lenders and the supply of credit does appear to have tightened more recently especially for less creditworthy borrowers,2
however as a longtime student of banking and financial crises i can attest that the current situation also has much in common with past experiences,2
earlier in 2007 markets perceived that subprime mortgage credit quality was deteriorating markedly,2
in particular since early this year investors have become increasingly concerned about the credit quality of mortgages especially subprime mortgages,2
those principles include expanded engagement with a broad range of stakeholders and experts rigorous and careful examination of financial vulnerabilities that may threaten our financial system and analytical examination of past reforms to ensure that they are making the financial system as resilient as it can be in the most efficient manner possible,2
strengthening resilience of financial markets reducing the likelihood of a severe financial crisis also requires strengthening the capacity of our financial markets and infrastructure to absorb shocks,2
we felt it was important to tailor implementation of basel ii to our own individual banking and financial environment as other authorities will be doing for their own markets even though it means the reconciliation of the different approaches to implementation across countries will create some complications for banking organizations,2
it is also clear that there will be a significant number of voluntary adopters of basel ii in the united states,2
for instance an increase in savings as          a growing share of the population nears retirement may reduce real rates          and raise asset prices,2
second the passage of the gramm leach bliley act in late 1999 recognized many of the market realities i discussed with you in 1998 and provided increased opportunity for the formation of large financial conglomerates,2
as you will hear recent readings on the economy suggest that the pace of economic activity has picked up of late our financial system is healthy and inflation pressures remain subdued,2
stock market losses during 2000 to 2002 had significantly eroded the value of pension assets while sharply declining interest rates had raised the current value of plan liabilities,2
here the longterm story is the technologydriven wave of innovation in retail credit delivery that dramatically expanded access to mortgage credit over the last decade just as it expanded access to unsecured consumer credit earlier on,2
but i will say this  while there are many risks in the policy that the fed has been pursuing and  god and anyone who has suffered through my speeches the past few years knows i  fret about those risks every manufacturer of goods in america has been given  a great gift by your central bankthe lowest cost of money in 237 years an extension  of the roaring bond market rally that has now run 32 years and a broad stock  market rally that began in march of 2009 and has gone on to bust through all  previous record highs,2
and although we have weathered the worst of the financial crisis we are still learning a lot about the effects of our policy tools on the economy as the recovery takes hold,2
the potential consequences of disruption in the financial system are so farreaching and the erosion of market discipline resulting from the government safety net sufficiently material that it is neither safe nor reasonable to rely entirely on afterthefact enforcement to ensure regulatory compliance,2
if policymakers are to detect emerging threats to the financial system we must understand the determinants of systemic risk and develop appropriate metrics for measuring it,2
if lenders including community bankers continue their prudent lending practices household financial conditions should be all the more likely to weather future challenges,2
however when there is a twoway feedback between financial conditions and fomc actions an initial perception that noisy recent data play a central role in the policy process can become somewhat selffulfilling and can itself be the cause of extraneous volatility in asset prices,2
any onset of increased investor caution elevates risk premiums and as a consequence lowers asset values and promotes the liquidation of the debt that supported higher asset prices,2
but in periods of severe financial stress such leverage too often brought down banking institutions and in some cases precipitated financial crises that led to recession or worse,2
a second benefit of simple rules is that they help financial market participants form a baseline for expectations regarding the future course of monetary policy,2
rather existing research suggests that asset price volatility remains          largely a reflection of variation in investors discount rates rather          than of changes in forecasts of fundamentals,2
drawing on recent work undertaken by a number of national regulators the fsf noted that there have been significant advances in risk management practices at financial institutions and strengthening of market infrastructure in recent years,2
the fifth and final regulatory change i want to mention is that the doddfrank act also gave the federal reserve more explicit responsibilities for safeguarding financial stability,2
likewise banks have a shared interest in ensuring that regulation overall promotes a strong and stable financial system that keeps credit flowing to households and businesses in the communities you serve,2
then these forces can come to sudden stops followed by a reversal of capital flows falling asset prices and credit contraction because of shrinking collateral for loans,2
in short intervening in the market process can create moral hazard and weaken market discipline,2
but central clearing will only make the financial system safer if ccps themselves are run safely,2
the absence of such direct measures of financial stability however suggests that we should continue to present our views of potential financial risks and their associated propagation mechanisms both to other publicsector colleagues and to privatesector analysts and observers,2
i am also skeptical about how effective or desirable monetary policy can be in restraining such asset price booms if they do occur,2
in addition financial conditions were accommodative for much of the year,2
appropriately given the unique position of the federal reserve and the sensitivity of financial markets to its communications these steps have generally been incremental in nature but taken together they have substantially increased the ability of the american public to understand and to anticipate monetary policy decisions,2
2 this clarification appears to have reduced market uncertainty about the committees current policy expectations,2
for example if regulators with responsibility for one sector believe that the failure of regulators with responsibility for another sector to act on financial stability concerns is creating debilitating disadvantages for firms in the first sector they might be tempted to relax regulation on their firms even though they might agree that the best outcome would be to retain their existing regulations but have the other sector subject to some constraints as well,2
some of the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis on financial markets in these countries occurred as a result of direct or indirect balance sheet exposures by their financial institutions to us securities,2
furthermore as i have emphasized in my writings mishkin 2006a financial globalization can help promote institutional reforms that can make the financial system more stable thereby contributing to more output stability,2
this is because during the last two decades there have been instances throughout the developed and developing worlds of prolonged buildups and sharp collapses in asset prices in stock housing and foreign exchange markets,2
conclusion        it is sobering to recognize that more than four years after the failure of bear stearns began the acute phase of the financial crisis so much remains to be donein implementing reforms that have already been developed in modifying or supplementing these reforms as needed and in fashioning a reform program to address shadow banking concerns,2
however the bankruptcy code does not always protect the publics strong interest in avoiding the disorderly collapse of a nonbank financial firm that could destabilize the financial system and damage the economy,2
but policymakers must also adapt their supervisory and regulatory structures to promote a robust financial system that can withstand occasional shocks even severe ones without systemic problems that become destabilizing,2
the doddfrank act does give regulators authority to require divestitures by firms posing risks to financial stability,2
will  5too bíg to fail policymakers and bank regulators have relied on the specter of the risk  of systemic failures in the financial system to justify the policy of toobigtofail,2
on october 3 on the recommendation of the administration and with the strong support of the federal reserve the congress approved the creation of the troubled asset relief program or tarp with a maximum authorization of 700 billion to support the stabilization of the us financial system,2
the acquisition of bear stearns by jpmorgan chase was facilitated by a federal reserve loan against a designated set of assets and the provision of liquidity to aig was collateralized by the assets of the largest insurance company in the united states,2
whats ahead i know you are most interested in the path from herethe path to recovery in the financial markets and by my inclusion the broader economy,2
at the height of the crisis we provided liquidity to help avert a collapse of the financial system which enabled banks and other institutions to continue to provide credit to people and businesses depending on it,2
policymakers tend to rescue the creditors of failing financial firms more often than they would have those creditors believe with the inevitable result that market expectations about the likelihood of bailouts increased7the ultimate result of constructive ambiguity was that the implicit safety net grew to include much of the socalled shadow banking system which i will discuss shortly,2
liquiditystrained institutions found themselves forced to sell positions which placed additional downward pressure on asset prices thereby accelerating margin calls on leveraged actors and amplifying marktomarket losses for all holders of the assets,2
the failure of lehman brothers highlighted the lack of a framework that would allow for the orderly resolution of a systemically important nonbank financial institution in the united states,2
in the popular press this was better known as the bank stress tests,2
i had hoped that the us would have led the world in setting out a concrete proposal to implement the basel iii endgame by the end of last year but the intervention of covid set back that timetable and although we are working hard with the other banking agencies to iron out the last issues our proposal will have to come after my departure,2
thus what we might refer to as the prototypical form of shadow banking presented the kind of risk associated with traditional banking prior to the creation of deposit insurancethat of destabilizing shortterm creditor runs that lead to defaults and asset fire sales,2
given new yorks preeminence as a center of global finance i thought it would be appropriate to discuss just such a topic which is how the federal reserve oversees the largest financial institutions many of which are headquartered or have a major presence here and how that oversight has strengthened since the financial crisis1    the financial crisis and large financial institutions        the crisis had many causes including the numerous factors that drove a lengthy housing boom and the expansion of a largely unregulated shadow banking system rivaling the traditional banking sector in size,2
by imposing a more standardized regulatory structure on the us operations of foreign banks we can ensure that enhanced prudential standards are applied consistently across foreign banks and in comparable ways between us banking organizations and foreign banking organizations,2
calibrating the enhanced capital standards        as i mentioned earlier the minimum and conservation buffer capital requirements of basel iii were calibrated by looking to the loss experience of larger banks,2
by lending to solvent institutions against illiquid collateral central banks effectively step in to assume the liquidity risk of such assetsthat is the risk that assets can only be sold in the near term at fire sale prices,2
but business spending moderated in the second half of the year as financial conditions tightened and uncertainty over tariffs trade policy and growth abroad began to weigh on manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports,2
bank capital and too big to fail let me turn now to the second prong of eliminating too big to fail  preventive measures that reduce the probability that a financial firm will fail in the first place,2
features of the enhanced capital requirement        while doddfrank mandates an enhanced capital requirement for sifis it does not specify the form of that requirement,2
first the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council fsoc which has the authority to bring within the perimeter of prudential regulation any nonbank financial firm whose failure could be the source of systemic problems,2
if the largest institutions were too big to fail during the financial crisis why not make them smaller,2
thus i believe that the real issue of whether adjustments in interest rates should be used to deal with problems of potential financial instability is macroeconomic and that if asset prices across the economythat is taking all financial markets into accountare thought to be excessively high raising the interest rate may be the appropriate step,2
the point is that starting with the collapse  of lehman brothers in september 2008 economic policy uncertainty has been  consistently high and half the time it has been extraordinarily high,2
putting it all together this reasoning suggests that the credit risk premiumas measured say by a forecasting model like that of greenwood and hansonmay be an operationally useful measure of financial market vulnerability,2
the more stringent regulation of the banking sector may push shortterm financing activities to less regulated entities,2
as shown in figure 5 assets under management in investmentgrade and highyield corporate bond mutual funds the solid blue area have hovered around 25 to 30 percent of the amount of outstanding corporate bonds in recent years up from about 15 percent before the crisisi          reduced market liquidity might exacerbate fire sale risks from leverage at financial institutions or from firstmover advantage at mutual funds,2
these requirements are designed to lower their probability of material financial distress or failure in order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the united states5  the proposed capital surcharge is the regulatory requirement that is most clearly calibrated to the size and complexity of an institution,2
the federal reserve recently became a full member of the network for greening the financial system ngfs a network of more than 80 central banks and supervisory authorities from around the world that focuses on sharing research and identifying best practices to ensure the financial system is resilient to climaterelated risks,2
thus both deregulation of the financial system and innovations in financial products have lessened the risk of asset price declines triggering substantial adverse effects in the financial sector,2
a second major force for change has been the rapid growth of bank holding companies and their nonbank affiliates,2
what monetary policy can do in response to current credit market problems is to provide the stable monetary environment necessary for investment and economic growth,2
however businesscycle conditions also influence rates as credit demands rise and fall with the cycle,2
the third change interstate banking has also become widespread despite the mcfadden act which limits national banks to branching within their headquarters state and the douglas amendment to the bank holding company act of 1956 which prohibits interstate expansion through acquisitions of banks in another state unless explicitly authorized by that state,2
they also raise the minimum standard o f total capital to  riskweighted assets to 8 percent by 1992  in sum the agenda for congress is to broaden banks powers to worldclass standards while decreasing the public exposure and moral hazard associated with deposit insurance,2
this situation is being called a credit crunch by some and a lack of credit demand by others,2
currently there is considerable financial market concern that foreign savers are becoming increasingly reluctant to place more of their savings in the us indeed there is growing fear that foreigners may even decide to pull their previous savings out of the us as well,2
a gradual removal of accommodation helps avoid a buildup of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat as well as risks to financial stability if interest rates remain too low and encourage investors to take on excessively risky investments in a search for yield,2
last years landmark financial reform legislation  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010  seeks to close the gap between the scope of prudential regulation and the scope of the implicit safety net,2
if expectations of support for the creditors of financially distressed institutions are widespread regulators will likely feel forced to provide support to these shortterm creditors to avoid the turbulence of disappointing expectations,2
it has arisen in direct response to the strong expansion in retail credit,2
it should be understood that if the united states resorts to protective trade barriers which lead to a breakdown down in pricing discipline the ultimate result will be higher interest rates and a tighter monetary policyheadway in reducing the federal budget deficit also has been slow,3
while shifts in is and lm curves can theoretically substitute for one another in academic models of stabilization policy empirical evidence suggests that monetary policy likely dominates fiscal policy as a  determinant of changes both in aggregate demand and inflation,3
our huge and growing trade deficit and themuch slower rate of us growth for some months  whilenot in itself exceptional during an expansion period should also be reminders enough that the responsibility forencouraging growth should not fall on one country aloneindeed looking ahead the historically high levels ofunemployment that have persisted in europe for some timefand the progress that has been made against inflationsuggest the potential for aboveaverage growth rates inthat key industrial center for a whileto me it is obvious as well that prospects forbalanced growth with more moderate interest rates in thiscountry would be greatly enhanced by a strong and earlyattack on our now chronically large budget deficit,3
probably the most important problem is the very large federal budget deficit,3
inthis regard a continued reduction in the federal deficit is crucial,3
substantial reductions in  federal budget deficits would ameliorate the situation but further progress beyond the recent budget compromise lies in the futureanother factor that could contribute to reduced inbalances would be somewhat faster economic growth in industrialized nations abroad,3
it therefore makes sense to reduce the federal deficit through spending restraint rather than the imposition of new taxes,3
if the private sector in any event could not find productive use for the money even if interest rates were lower and the functioning of markets improved no idmediate damage would be done by even a high budget deficit,3
consequently even though the trade balance will improve only slowly over the next two years the volume of exportsand imports as wellis likely to continue growing,3
for example the fiscal 1975 budget proposed by the administration is an increase of 12 per cent over fiscal 1974 which was an 8 per cent increase over 1973 with the real economy growing at about 4 per cent per year on average in recent years and the dramatic size of government spending totals we must question the inevitable annual dramatic increases in government spending,3
in particular saving may increase so as to finance the deficit without increasing interest rates or crowding out private sector activitythe effects of deficits also depend on the reaction of monetary policy,3
borrowing to finance budget deficits increases the governments total outstanding debt,3
conversely suppose that expansionary fiscal policy resulted in a rise in budget deficits,3
yet there is little evidence indicating that reductions of government spending have lasting adverse effects on overall economic growth,3
this conflict is due to the adverse effects higher tax rates have on incentives to work save invest and innovate,3
i do not believe that it is just a coincidence that two of the longest most vigorous noninflationary economic expansions of this century occurred after major tax rate reductions and during periods of relatively restrained monetary policy,3
according to the congressional budget office estimates this agreement will lead to significant reductions in the budget deficit over the next few years,3
attempts to curtail foreign investment could cause the exchange rate to decline sharply and interest rates to increase thereby crowding out private investment,3
if the restructurers assessment of the potential of the corporation is correct and the necessary funds are  forthcoming a more efficient allocation of resources resultsmore generally the validity of the freecash flow theory as an explanation for the recent wave of corporate restructuring in the american economy depends on the truth of three key assertions 1 many corporations are in fact managed inefficiently 2 the stock market recognizes inefficient management and as a result share prices trade at significant discounts and 3 lenders correctly judge that the freecash flow will comfortably support the increased debt burden incurred to finance the upfront payment to shareholders of the acquired corporationthe history of the oil industry in the early 1980s provides the clearest evidence for the freecash flow theory and is no doubt familiar to many in the audience here today,3
sharplyhigher interest rates increased debt service requirements rapidlyrelative to the capacity to service debt,3
unemployment causes large federal deficits which contribute to inflation,3
h o w well even approach price stability unless  w e keep m o r e restraint on federal spending or increase taxes is difficult to foresee,3
longterm reinvestment and to sane extent even that of the nearterm is seriously jeopardized however by the consequences of our current  8gargantuan and unprecedented federal budget deficits and more importantly by the even larger deficits projected for years to ccmethe resulting imbalances and sane of the deleterious repercussions are already apparent,3
broadening the access to home ownership sharing prosperity and insuring opportunity monetary and fiscal policies have not been the only public policies that have benefited the housing industry in recent years,3
some market makers would then see continued high interest rates resulting from massive budget deficits and deep uncertainty,3
there is already some evidence that increases in defense spending are winding down to levels consistent with the congressional budget resolution for fiscal year 1986 a second source of strength in the third quarter was the large commodity credit corporation purchases of agricultural products,3
in my remarks today i shall proffer a set of considerations that i find quite valuable as a guide to decisions about the need for government regulation of financial markets,3
the reagan administrations orientation toward less government involvement is well known but many of the initiatives for deregulation were begun even before president reagans election,3
fiscal policy has also turned more restricive in recent quarters and indeed the president has submitted to congress a revised budget which shows a surplus for fiscal year 1981 by one measure the net swing toward restrictiveness in fiscal policy has been about 40 billion over the last couple of years,3
in recognition of the importance of financial consolidation its potential impact on market structure and its potential implications for public policy concerns the finance ministers and central bank governors of the g10 nations in late 1999 asked their deputies to study financial consolidation and its potential effects,3
my approach to the customer protection issue would be to start with the fundamental concerns of public policy and derive policy prescriptions from a careful and rigorous assessment of the need to achieve specific public policy objectives in an effective and efficient manner,3
2019 recession ready fiscal policies to stabilize the american economy,3
japan and west germany could stimulate their economies by accelerating tax cuts and implementing a generally more expansive fiscal policy,3
this indicates that consumers may have digested delayed  tax rebates and the increase in payroll taxes and are reaping the benefits of  lower gasoline and food prices,3
furthermore the income tax reduction of 1964 represented a substantial easing of fiscal policy which helped move the economy further toward full use of its resources while interest rates instead of declining were permitted to rise further in the hope of reducing incentives to capital outflowsthird in a more drastic departure from traditional policy the united states in 1963 introduced the interest equalization tax in order to insert a degree of insulation between the domestic and international capital markets,3
tax rates were cut and expenditures increased when recessionary forces were pervasive,3
tax rate increases of sufficient dimension to deal with our looming fiscal problems arguably pose significant risks to economic growth and the revenue base,3
more recently demands for us exports also have been adversely affected by internal adjustment programs of large developing countries necessitated by their serious external debt problems,3
a major source o f shortterm strength is fiscal policy which is highly stimulative,3
13if the federal reserve pursues a disciplined course of monetary policy in 1934 as i believe it will serious conflict is threatened with the increasingly stimulative fiscal policy embodied in current law,3
10i am extremely sensitive to the fact that rising interest rates have damaging effects on farmers on small businesses on thrift institutions and on developing countries struggling to find ways to service large external debts,3
hopefully the marginal tax rate reductions already in law for future dates can be brought forward and implemented earlier,3
in april that external deficit increased substantially furtherduring the first five months of 1984 the treasury borrowed 74 billion on its way to financing a gap between federal receipts and expendituresboth on and off budget that will probably total about 195 billion during this calendar yeari would like to talk with you briefly today about our internal deficitthat is the deficit in the federal budgetand our external deficitsthe deficits on merchandise trade and current accountand the relationship between them,3
perhaps those that are disadvantaged by an overcid173valued dollar and large external deficits should take comfort in the fact that the present situation cannot last indefinitely,3
however although the paygo budget rule for example appeared to help keep legislation from increasing federal deficits for a number of years paygo did not provide a mechanism to deal with the longterm budget imbalances already in place,3
too frequently their economic growth has been constrained and stifled by a large public sectors unintended effects on the economy and its ability to adapt to change,3
consumer spending which accounts for more than twothirds of us gdp proved to be quite resilient in 2013 despite the rise in payroll taxes at the start of the year a government shutdown significant uncertainties about future tax policy and the implications of healthcare reform,3
were a government regulator a private business and an academic research center,3
we are in the midst of a massive cutback in defense spending which will result in the virtual elimination of many kinds of jobs,3
first tax increases and spending cuts of the magnitude proposed enacted simultaneously must be assumed to be contractionary,3
recognizing that a onesizefitsall approach is seldom appropriate it may be useful to offer transactors a choice between seeking the benefits and accepting the burdens of government regulation or forgoing those benefits and avoiding those burdens by transacting in financial markets that are only privately regulated,3
2the full employment and balanced growth act of 1978 the humphreyhawkins act requires the federal reserve to carry out monetary policy in a manner consistent with the maintenance of full employment and balanced growth,3
according to that prescription such a sprint was to be followed by quick fiscal and monetary restraint as the capacity ceiling wa being approached to slow the economy down to its longrun potential growth rate,3
conversely decisions that reduce either the current level or the growth of government expenditures from what they otherwise would have been are a genuine reduction in tax burdens even if explicit tax revenue is not altered,3
finally a tighter fiscal policy would reduce the governments borrowing in the capital market and given a monetary policy that maintains a constant growth of money and credit would lead to lower interest ratesenergetic restraint of government spending is desirable for still another reason,3
meanwhile without oil taxes as a share of gdp are still among the lowest in  latin america despite the current governments bold efforts to increase tax  revenue,3
the first is the federal budget deficit which will remain  far too high for yet another year in 1990 the second is related to the first our need to finance  excess government spending  with imported capital has led to continuing  imbalances in trade between the united states and our major trading partners,3
the benefits of a tax cut of increased public spending are felt within a few weeks or quarters,3
the proceeds of the tax would be used to reduce income taxes in the lower brackets or alternatively to compensate the employees of the taxpaying companies in proportion to their wage shortfall with respect to profitsthe excess profits tax would take the form of an increase in the regular corporate income tax for all corporations whether they had abnormal profits or not,3
g0 current account in the balance of payments has improvedthough less than we would have liked,3
it includes personalincome tax cuts and accelerated depreciation w riteoffs designed to stim ulate a longawaited improvement in productivityenhancing investment,3
as interstate taxation of depositories but also on the subcid173jects as broad as all regulatory reform the economy may be growing better than even the most optimistic analyses in the short run the longer range problems unemployment productivity capital formation energy conversion large government deficits and inflation are still to be resolved i suggest that a comprehensive regulatory reform review can be useful to the resolution of these issues in the most utopian view we can get rid of unintended and debilitating side effects from present law and regulation we may even get rid of bad law perhaps although im not too optimistic about that but surely this is also a process of national education that will help identify priorities and balance them in full view of the electorate all of this will be a very politically difficult program but just as importantto the tennessee bankers association as regulation q or the ftc decision on the liabilities of a holder in due course  i am sure you will have a good convention and i am 0e6ighted to ave been able to join you i think i will go by the hermitage this afternoon on my way out of town from what andrew jackson said when he opposed grantin control of the currency to the general government i think he would be r6eased that monetary policy is in the hands of the federal reserve thank you  t,3
a personal tax cut of perhaps 35 billion as is being talked about would further increase the amount to be borrowed depending on when the cut became effectiveif that borrowing were made easier by the federal reserve through an increased growth in the money supply it would surely be inflationaryif the fed did not make borrowing easier interest rates would go up,3
sizable fiscal stimulus has provided an important boost to demand this year and will likely contribute somewhat further next year given the usual lags in outlays and in the effects of tax cuts on business and household spending,3
at the same time some businesses attributed the firmwide bonuses they paid to workers at the end of the year to the tax cuts and others have taken the occasion to implement wage increases they had contemplated for some time,3
these are financial services industry restructuring the federal budget deficit and inflation,3
a more flexible fiscal policy would also reduce the likelihood that demand pressures on the economy would cumulate to the point where they become difficult if not impossible to control without undesired sideeffects,3
when the government runs deficits it siphons off private savings reducing national saving leaving less available for capital investment,3
notably concerns about the ability of greece and a number of other euroarea countries to manage their sizable budget deficits and high levels of public debt roiled global financial markets in the spring including our own,3
on the other hand increased government expenditures are viewed as adding directly to total demand and tax reductions are thought to add to disposable income which subsequently is used to purchase goods and services,3
government spending has increased substantially in the past year contributing importantly to the recovery but it will be much less of a stimulant to the economy this year,3
new and substantial tax reductions occurred again in 1969 and 1971 and they too were followed by massive increases of expenditures,3
takehome pay was boosted by the frontloading of  the 23billion tax reduction act which included not only the tax reductions but also some increases in socialsecurity and other transfer payments,3
on the upside the tax package and increased federal spending in the us are expected to add to an already healthy level of spending in the second half of this year and next year but the magnitudes and exact timing are still somewhat uncertain,3
budget surpluses were projectedand for a brief time actually realized partly because of increased aid from washington and also because of such factors as a wide spread increase in tax rates and a falling real demand for costly educational services,3
although tax action would reduce the federal governments need to borrow during the fiscal year beginning july 1 the treasury may still have to borrow a sizable amount during the summer months,3
tht program includes a commiment to greater fiscal restraint through the containment of federal spending,3
in the united states the feds job could be greatly enhanced by congressional commitment to control federal spending     13 and legislative action to modernize our banking system,3
in the early 1980s this linkage between the fiscal regime and the implications for the monetary environments was labeled the dismal arithmetic of monetarism this premise held that any country that found it politically difficult to achieve and maintain a disciplined fiscal policy would ultimately resort to the unlegislated tax of debasing the currency,3
even more important is to gain better control over federal spending and to reduce the relative role of federal expenditured in our national economy,3
the consequence is that it will take an immediate payroll tax increase now estimated at 26 percent bringing the total to 15 percent just to pay for the present benefit system over the standard seventyfive year forecasting period and a greater tax increase if this period is extended even a few years,3
for our failure to control inflation after the mid1960s was a key element in the rapid deterioration of our balance of payments,3
the midwest states have done a good job in developing prudent fiscal policies,3
it was a slow and tedious process to get congress to enact the tax cut but it seems even more of a task to obtain a tax increase since late 1965 the economy has obviously needed fiscal restraint a tax increase or less government spending but congress has not acted,3
incomes in the north east areas of the country and in the mid and far west will sustain at a given tax rate higher levels of public expenditures than will those7digitized for fraser httpfraserstlouisfedorg federal reserve bank of st louis7from a high of 551 per person in one state to the low of 221 in anothercid173the difference between the two being greater than the national average a less dranatic but more scientific way of sunmarizing the excid173tent of differences in total expenditure pattens would be to compute a measure of relative dispersion which would tell us how closely clustered the various states were to the u s average,3
then unless the stimulus of huge government deficits financed by rapid monetary expansion is removed only gradually the economy would again suffer from inadequate  demand falling production and rising unemployment,3
this can be clearly seen from the fact that in 1975 when the us had a 9billion trade surplus the international value of the dollar was even lower than now yet in 1976 and the first half of 1977 the value of the dollar actually increased while the trade balance deteriorated,3
a more useful question for debate regarding monetary policy thus far in the 1960s is whether a still easier policy might not have speeded up economic expansion in 1962 and 1963before the tax cut was enacted,3
monetaey control and sound fiscal policies orderly economic growth and reasonably stable prices m compatible i decline to aocept the doctrine thet we can not have price stability without heavy unemployment,3
while the rise in the federal governments purchases of goods and services particularly for defense purposes was the major source of pressure on real resources during much of the period variations in business expenditures for fixed equipment also had a signifcid173icant role,3
since 1947 the federal debt has increased from 257 to 290 billion and there have been some serious deficits since 1958 the increase in federal debt is not as disturbing in view of the growth of gnp and the national income as the tendency for observers around the iorld to i1onder if recurrent budget deficits signal difficulty ahead in maintaincid173ing the value of the dollar esnecially if we do not have surpluses in boom ye,3
throughout the current long business expansion the federal reserve has aimed at supplying banks with enough reserves to accomcid173modate the needs of a growing domestic economy but hopefully not so much as to promote excessive and inflationary use of credit at home or to contribute to a worsening balance of payments situation internationally,3
when the united states entered world war i income taxes were increased sharply in 1917 tax rates were also raised promptly in 1941 and 1942 in connection with world war ii,3
when taxes were cut in 1980 without parallel cuts in spending our government had to borrow increasingly to make up the difference,3
still it seems regrettable to have to identify one class of creditors that is eligible for losses with the presumption being that all others receive support rather than the usual approach of providing explicit government guarantees such as deposit insurance to some creditors and presuming that all others are at risk,3
the fiscal policy supports implemented early in the crisis helped mitigate the worst of the immediate fallout for many families,3
at that time the retirement of the large baby boom population was anticipated and payroll tax revenues were accumulated in advance of benefit payments steps that created the presentday cash surpluses for the social security component of the overall federal budget,3
although we have scant data on crossborder transactions among the separate states anecdotal evidence suggests that over the decades significant apparent imbalances have been resolved without precipitating interstate balance of payments crises,3
rather than raising payroll taxes he would have made transfers of general federal revenues to the social security trust fund,3
educating the public about the consequences of unsustainable fiscal policies may be one way to help build that support,3
one source of competition could be the us governments funding needs associated with large fiscal deficits if congress cannot maintain an effective budgetdeficit reduction program,3
here in the united states we have begun to deal with two of our longestrunning problems the increasing budget deficits and health care costs,3
as mentioned above such a fiscal austerity policy  is the only known way to correct persistent budget deficits,3
compliance with the bank secrecy act  since the passage of the usa patriot act in 2001 which significantly amended the bank secrecy act compliance in this area has been a major concern for the banking industry,3
today i want to touch on two regulatory issues that are currently high on the list of both bankers and supervisors  bank secrecy act compliance and basel ii implementation,3
these efforts are intended to better ensure consistency in the bank secrecy act and antimoneylaundering supervision programs of the bank regulators and fincenthe entity within the us treasury that is statutorily responsible for the implementing the bank secrecy act,3
more than half of that represents guarantees implied by precedents rather than legislative guarantees such as deposit insurance16  given the rescue expectations that have built up over the last several decades i believe it will take more than a sincere pledge to limit central bank lending to solve the time consistency problem,3
such a framework could include a commitment to make a down payment on fiscal consolidation by enacting legislation to reduce the structural deficit over the next several years,3
my baseline outlook as you can tell from this discussion two things i see as critical for a sustainable recovery are 1 the effective control of the virus and 2 adequate additional fiscal support,3
add to this pattern of private sector spending moderate growth in government spending on goods and services and you have solid growth in what economists call domestic final sales,3
inflation and crowdingout now substantial budget deficits can be defended in deep recession periods because they support aggregate business activity at tim es when other credit demands are weak,3
as with float and currency those monetary managers who desire a prescribed market tone as a measure of monetary action find these shortrun fluctuations in the treasurys balances at the reserve banks of extreme importance,3
the fed has done a great deal to date to promote recovery but the ongoing effectiveness of fed efforts does depend critically on the removal of fiscal policy uncertainty,3
the adm inistration has taken an unprecedented step by reopening the books on its 1981 budget document only a month and a half after sending it to congress with the intention of ending the inflation stim ulus created by continued massive federal deficits,3
as a result o f massive federal budget deficits we have been exporting ious in the form o f treasury securities for the past five years or so,3
then i would urge  you to write those people you sent to congress and express your concern about inflation,3
they have a wide menu of choices including increases in taxes  or revenue enhancements if you will  and reductions in various spending components,3
but we have to keep in mind that when baby boomers start  michael moskow speeches  1995  57  retiring theyll be paying less in taxes and receiving more in retirement benefits for a longer time than was true for previous generations,3
foremost among these is the federal budget deficit which will  remain far too high for yet another year in 1990  a second is related to the firsts our  need to finance excess government spending with imported capital has led to continuing imbalances in trade between the united states and our major trading partners,3
we have already placed a substantial burden on future generations and we must begin to reduce the burden,3
while state and local purchases will grow government spending overall will be weak because purchases on the federal level are being affected by defense cutbacks and deficit reduction,3
while state and local purchases will grow government spending overall will be weak because expenditures at the federal level are being affected by defense cutbacks and deficit reduction,3
in technical terms the time inconsistency problem in conducting monetary policy which is one of the most important elements in the recent professional literature on policy would be much more compelling in a policy regime with a 3 to 4 percent inflation objective than in a regime firmly committed to price stability,3
more specifically any holder of a longterm bond is exposed to  interest rate risk because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates  vary,3
such oversight should be aimed at measuring and efficiently constraining private risk taking that could affect the extension of central bank credit or the provision of public sector support,3
as a result financial market participants are understandably apprehensive about whether a particular counterpartys mortgagerelated losses will erode their capital buffer enough to threaten their viabilitythird market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector intervention4 the disparate responses to potential failures at several highprofile organizations this year may have made it difficult for market participants to forecast whether official support would be forthcoming for a given counterparty,3
