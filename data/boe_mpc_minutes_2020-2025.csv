At its meeting ending on 29 January 2020, the MPC voted by a majority of 7-2 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.75%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £435 billion. UK GDP growth slowed last year, reflecting weaker global growth and elevated Brexit uncertainties. Output is expected to have been flat in 2019 Q4. Growth in regular pay has fallen back to around 3½%, though unit labour costs have continued to grow at rates above those consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term. CPI inflation fell to 1.3% in December, core CPI inflation declined to 1.4%, and core services inflation is below its target-consistent range. The unemployment rate has remained low and stable, and employment growth has picked up. Following its annual reassessment of supply-side conditions, the Committee judges that there has been a somewhat greater margin of spare capacity in the economy over recent years, which has been exerting downward pressure on domestically generated inflation. The most recent indicators suggest that global growth has stabilised, reflecting the partial easing of trade tensions and the significant loosening of monetary policy by many central banks over the past year. Global business confidence and other manufacturing indicators have generally picked up. Domestically, near-term uncertainties facing businesses and households have receded. Surveys of business activity have picked up, quite markedly in some cases, and investment intentions appear to have recovered. Housing market indicators have strengthened and consumer confidence has increased slightly. The Committee will monitor closely the extent to which these early indications of an improved outlook are sustained and follow through to the hard data on domestic activity in coming months. The Committee’s updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying January Monetary Policy Report . They are based on the assumption of an immediate but orderly move, at the beginning of next year, to a deep free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. UK GDP growth is projected to pick up a little in early 2020. Further ahead, and conditioned on a market path for Bank Rate that falls slightly over the forecast period, the recovery in UK growth is supported by a pickup in global activity, a further decline in Brexit uncertainties and the Government’s announced spending measures. Support from these factors is sufficient to boost demand growth above weakened potential supply growth. As a result, slack is eroded gradually over the first part of the forecast period and a margin of excess demand builds thereafter. CPI inflation is projected to remain below the MPC’s 2% target throughout this year and much of 2021. Further out, and conditioned on market yields, strengthening domestic price pressures, alongside a waning drag from energy prices, mean that inflation reaches the 2% target by the end of next year and rises slightly above it by the end of the forecast period. Monetary policy will be set to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. Policy may need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth should the more positive signals from recent indicators of global and domestic activity not be sustained or should indicators of domestic prices remain relatively weak. Further ahead, if the economy recovers broadly in line with the MPC’s latest projections, some modest tightening of policy may be needed to maintain inflation sustainably at the target. The MPC judges at this meeting that the existing stance of monetary policy is appropriate.

Related links Related links Interest rates and Bank Rate Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting Published on 26 March 2020 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and thereby helps to sustain growth and employment. In that context, its challenge over recent weeks has been to respond to the severe economic and financial disruption caused by the spread of Covid-19. The spread of the disease and the measures that are likely to be needed to contain it have evolved significantly. The economic consequences of these developments are becoming more apparent and a very sharp reduction in activity is likely. Given the severity of that disruption, there is a risk of longer-term damage to the economy, especially if there are business failures on a large scale or significant increases in unemployment. In the near term, many people will be unable to work for a period and others are adjusting their working arrangements. Many consumer-facing companies are now required to cease operations for a time, while other businesses have also needed to cease or scale back their activities. Household spending on social activities and other delayable forms of consumption is likely to decline materially. In an environment of heightened uncertainty, businesses are likely to postpone investment decisions. Exports are likely to weaken. These effects on economic activity will be offset partly by temporarily higher spending on essential goods and services. Nonetheless, business cashflows will be severely affected in a way that, without support measures, would threaten material numbers of businesses failing, and large and persistent rises in unemployment. There is little evidence as yet to assess the precise magnitude of the economic shock from Covid-19. It is probable that global GDP will fall sharply during the first half of this year. Unemployment is likely to rise rapidly across a range of economies, as suggested by early indicators. In the United Kingdom, even before the introduction of the most recent social distancing measures, the composite flash output and expectation PMIs fell sharply in March to their all-time lowest levels, consistent with a material contraction in GDP. Other timely indicators of activity, such as footfall in shops and the number of flights, have also declined sharply. There have been very significant moves in a range of financial market prices and implied volatilities have risen to historically elevated levels, with evidence of widespread disruption to market functioning. Risky asset prices have fallen and, in the period leading up to the MPC’s special meeting on 19 March, yields on longer-term government debt rose. Additional demand for US dollar liquidity contributed to disruption in dollar funding markets, and in other usually liquid markets. The sterling exchange rate has depreciated sharply. Overall, UK and global financial conditions have tightened materially. All major central banks have set out wide-ranging policy responses that have helped to stabilise markets and improve liquidity in government bond markets. What public policy is doing The front line of combatting the challenges of Covid-19 comprises the extraordinary efforts of NHS health professionals, carers and volunteers across the country. Monetary policy should take into account the broader public policy response to reduce the disruptive consequences for households and businesses of the spread of Covid-19. This should help to minimise the longer-term damage to the economy when the health crisis abates. In this environment, it is essential that monetary and financial stability are maintained, as these are pre-requisites of longer-term economic prosperity. Consistent with this, the Bank of England has coordinated its actions with those of the UK Government in order to ensure that these initiatives are complementary and have maximum impact in supporting households and businesses during this period of disruption. The Government has announced a series of substantial fiscal support measures to alleviate some of the severe cashflow problems facing businesses and households. The Bank of England also has a role to play in supporting businesses and households through the economic disruption associated with Covid-19. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) reduced the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0% of banks’ exposures to UK borrowers at its policy meeting on 9 March. This action supports the ability of banks to supply the credit needed by households and businesses. The FPC, together with the Prudential Regulation Committee, will monitor closely the response of banks to recent measures, as well as the credit conditions faced by UK businesses and households more generally. On 17 March, HM Treasury announced the creation of the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF), for which the Bank would act as HM Treasury’s agent. This will provide funding to businesses by purchasing commercial paper of up to a one-year maturity. As an alternative source of finance for larger companies, the scheme will help preserve the capacity of the banking system to lend to other companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises. The CCFF is being funded by the issuance of additional central bank reserves but is set up in a separate legal entity from the Bank and from the Asset Purchase Facility. The MPC will continue to decide on the overall amount of asset purchases that are financed by central bank reserves. It is therefore taking the size of the CCFF into account when taking its decisions on the target stock of government and corporate bonds financed by reserves necessary to fulfil its remit. The role of monetary policy As set out in the Chancellor’s letter on 11 March, the MPC has statutory objectives to maintain price stability and, subject to that, to support the economic policy of the Government including its objectives for growth and employment. The updated remit letter confirms that the operational target for monetary policy remains an inflation rate of 2% measured by the 12-month increase in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). CPI inflation was 1.7% in February. Prior to recent developments, inflation was already set to fall further below the MPC’s 2% target. It is now likely to decline to below 1% in the spring, reflecting the pass-through to fuel prices of the recent and sharp decline in the oil price. Further ahead, inflation will be boosted by the significant depreciation of the sterling exchange rate. The MPC will be monitoring closely developments in inflation and in indicators of inflation expectations, including those of households, businesses and financial markets. Financial market measures of inflation expectations have not risen over recent weeks. The nature of the economic shock from Covid-19 is very different from those to which the MPC has previously had to respond. The scale and duration of the shock to economic activity, while highly uncertain, will be large and sharp but should ultimately prove temporary, particularly if job losses and business failures can be minimised. In the current circumstances, and consistent with the MPC’s remit, monetary policy is aimed at guarding against an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions and, more broadly, supporting businesses and households through the crisis and limiting any lasting damage to the economy. What the MPC is doing Over recent weeks, the MPC has reduced Bank Rate by 65 basis points, from 0.75% to 0.1%, and introduced a Term Funding scheme with additional incentives for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (TFSME). It has also announced an increase in the stock of asset purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £200 billion to a total of £645 billion. Those purchases are being undertaken as soon as operationally possible, consistent with improved market functioning. The majority of additional asset purchases would comprise UK government bonds. Some additional sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bonds would also be purchased. At its meeting ending on 25 March 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee also voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with the programme of £200 billion of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, to take the total stock of these purchases to £645 billion. The MPC will monitor closely the pass-through to banks and building societies’ lending rates of the recent reductions in Bank Rate. Regarding the impact of asset purchases, gilt yields fell significantly following the previous week’s special MPC meeting and the commencement of additional gilt purchase operations from 20 March. If needed, the MPC can expand asset purchases further. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely and, consistent with its remit, stands ready to respond further as necessary to guard against an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions, and support the economy.

Related links Related links Interest rates and Bank Rate Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting Published on 07 May 2020 Authorities around the world are taking action to halt the spread of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and to support economic activity. The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. In that context, its challenge is to respond to the severe economic and financial disruption caused by the spread of Covid-19. At its meeting ending on 6 May 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted by a majority of 7-2 for the Bank of England to continue with the programme of £200 billion of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, to take the total stock of these purchases to £645 billion. Two members preferred to increase the target for the stock of asset purchases by an additional £100 billion at this meeting. The spread of Covid-19 and the measures to contain it are having a significant impact on the United Kingdom and many countries around the world. Activity has fallen sharply since the beginning of the year and unemployment has risen markedly. Economic data have continued to be consistent with a sudden and very marked drop in global activity. Oil prices have been volatile. There have, however, been tentative signs of recovery in domestic spending in China, and this is likely to be echoed in other countries that have started to relax Covid-related restrictions on economic activity. Financial markets have recovered somewhat over recent weeks and risky asset prices have picked up from their lows in mid-March. This in part reflects the actions taken by authorities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Global financial conditions have, nevertheless, remained tighter than prior to the outbreak of Covid-19. The timeliest indicators of UK demand have generally stabilised at very low levels in recent weeks, after unprecedented falls during late March and early April. Payments data point to a reduction in the level of household consumption of around 30%. Consumer confidence has declined markedly and housing market activity has practically ceased. According to the Bank’s Decision Maker Panel, companies’ sales are expected to be around 45% lower than normal in 2020 Q2 and business investment 50% lower. There has been widespread take-up of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Nevertheless, sharp increases in benefit claims are consistent with a pronounced rise in the unemployment rate. CPI inflation declined to 1.5% in March and is likely to fall below 1% in the next few months, in large part reflecting developments in energy prices. The unprecedented situation means that the outlook for the UK and global economies is unusually uncertain. It will depend critically on the evolution of the pandemic, and how governments, households and businesses respond to it. Recognising these uncertainties, the MPC has constructed a plausible illustrative economic scenario in the accompanying May Monetary Policy Report. This scenario is based on a set of stylised assumptions about the pandemic and the responses of governments, households and businesses, and, as usual, on the prevailing levels of asset prices and the market path for interest rates. While the scenario is highly conditional, it helps to illustrate the potential impact of Covid-19 on the economy and the channels through which the impact is felt. The Report also includes a number of estimates of the sensitivity of the economy to a selection of key variables, which, taken alongside the scenario, serve to illustrate the important drivers of the outlook. The illustrative scenario incorporates a very sharp fall in UK GDP in 2020 H1 and a substantial increase in unemployment in addition to those workers who are furloughed currently. Given the assumed path for the relaxation of social distancing measures, the fall in GDP should be temporary and activity should pick up relatively rapidly. Nonetheless, because a degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is assumed to persist, the economy takes some time to recover towards its previous path. CPI inflation is expected to fall further below the 2% target during the second half of this year, largely reflecting the weakness of demand. As set out in the accompanying interim Financial Stability Report, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) has assessed the risks to UK financial stability and the resilience of the UK financial system to the economic and market shocks associated with Covid-19. Drawing on the MPC’s illustrative scenario, the FPC judges that the core banking system has capital buffers more than sufficient to absorb losses and, supported by government guarantees for new lending and Bank of England funding, the capacity to provide credit to support the UK economy. The MPC has statutory objectives to maintain price stability and, subject to that, to support the economic policy of the Government including its objectives for growth and employment. In the current circumstances, and consistent with the MPC’s remit, monetary policy is aimed at supporting businesses and households through the crisis, and limiting any lasting damage to the economy. Since the onset of the Covid-19 shock, the MPC has, complementing the responses of other parts of the Bank of England and the UK Government, taken a number of actions to fulfil its mandate. The Committee has reduced Bank Rate to 0.1%; has introduced a Term Funding scheme with additional incentives for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (TFSME); and announced a £200 billion increase in the stock of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, to be carried out as soon as operationally possible and consistent with improved market functioning. The Committee notes that the stock of asset purchases will reach £645 billion by the beginning of July, at the current pace of purchases. The Committee continues to monitor closely a range of indicators of market functioning. In the illustrative scenario, the recovery in economic activity is relatively rapid and inflation rises to around the 2% target, conditional on the scenario assumptions that include a gradual easing in social distancing, and supported by the very significant monetary and fiscal stimulus. Relative to the scenario, the Committee assesses that the balance of risks to the economic outlook lies to the downside. At this meeting, the Committee judges that the existing stance of monetary policy is appropriate. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely and, consistent with its remit, stands ready to take further action as necessary to support the economy and ensure a sustained return of inflation to the 2% target.

Bank Rate maintained at 0.1% and asset purchases increased by £100bn - June 2020,"Bank Rate maintained at 0.1% and asset purchases increased by £100bn - June 2020 Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting Related links Related links Interest rates and Bank Rate Published on 18 June 2020 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. In that context, its challenge at present is to respond to the severe economic and financial disruption caused by the spread of Covid-19. At its meeting ending on 17 June 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with the existing programme of £200 billion of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. The Committee voted by a majority of 8-1 for the Bank of England to increase the target stock of purchased UK government bonds, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by an additional £100 billion, to take the total stock of asset purchases to £745 billion. Risky asset prices have recovered further from their March lows, although they have remained sensitive to news on the evolution of the pandemic. Recent data outturns suggest that the fall in global GDP in 2020 Q2 will be less severe than expected at the time of the May Monetary Policy Report. There are signs of consumer spending and services output picking up, following the easing of Covid-related restrictions on economic activity. Recent additional announcements of easier monetary and fiscal policy will help to support the recovery. Downside risks to the global outlook remain, however, including from the spread of Covid-19 within emerging market economies and from a return to a higher rate of infection in advanced economies. UK GDP contracted by around 20% in April, following a 6% fall in March. Evidence from more timely indicators suggests that GDP started to recover thereafter. Payments data are consistent with a recovery in consumer spending in May and June, and housing activity has started to pick up recently. The LFS unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.9% in the three months to April. But other and more timely indications from the claimant count, HMRC payrolls data and job vacancies suggest that the labour market has weakened materially. Following stronger than expected take-up of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, a greater number of workers are likely to be furloughed in the second quarter. Evidence from business surveys and the Bank’s Agents is consistent with a weak outlook for employment in coming quarters. Some households are also worried about their job security. Twelve-month CPI inflation declined from 1.5% in March to 0.8% in April, triggering the explanatory letter from the Governor to the Chancellor published alongside this monetary policy announcement. CPI inflation fell further in May, to 0.5%. Current below-target rates of CPI inflation can in large part be accounted for by the effects of the pandemic. The collapse in global oil prices has had direct effects on inflation, via the prices of motor fuels, and indirect effects by reducing input costs in other sectors of the economy. The sharp drop in domestic activity is also adding to downward pressure on inflation through increased spare capacity in most sectors of the economy. The unprecedented situation means that the outlook for the UK and global economies is unusually uncertain. It will depend critically on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how governments, households and businesses respond to these factors. The emerging evidence suggests that the fall in global and UK GDP in 2020 Q2 will be less severe than set out in the May Report. Although stronger than expected, it is difficult to make a clear inference from that about the recovery thereafter. There is a risk of higher and more persistent unemployment in the United Kingdom. Even with the relaxation of some Covid-related restrictions on economic activity, a degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is likely to persist. The economy, and especially the labour market, will therefore take some time to recover towards its previous path. CPI inflation is well below the 2% target and is expected to fall further below it in coming quarters, largely reflecting the weakness of demand. At this meeting, the MPC judges that a further easing of monetary policy is warranted to meet its statutory objectives. The Committee agreed to increase the target stock of purchased UK government bonds by an additional £100 billion in order to meet the inflation target in the medium term. The Committee expects that programme to be completed, and the total stock of asset purchases to reach £745 billion, around the turn of the year. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely and, consistent with its remit, stands ready to take further action as necessary to support the economy and ensure a sustained return of inflation to the 2% target. The Committee will keep the asset purchase programme under review.

In that context, its challenge at present is to respond to the economic and financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. At its meeting ending on 4 August 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programmes of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the total stock of these purchases at £745 billion. The Committee’s projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report. Although recent developments suggest a less weak starting point for the Committee’s latest projections, it is unclear how informative they are about how the economy will perform further out. The outlook for the UK and global economies remains unusually uncertain. It will depend critically on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how governments, households and businesses respond to these factors. The MPC’s projections assume that the direct impact of Covid-19 on the economy dissipates gradually over the forecast period. Given the inherent uncertainties regarding the evolution of the pandemic, the MPC’s medium-term projections are a less informative guide than usual. Global activity has strengthened over recent months, although it generally remains below its level in 2019 Q4. Covid-19 has continued to spread rapidly within a number of emerging market economies, however, and there has been a renewed rise in cases in many advanced economies. UK GDP is expected to have been over 20% lower in 2020 Q2 than in 2019 Q4. But higher-frequency indicators imply that spending has recovered significantly since the trough in activity in April. Payments data suggest that household consumption in July was less than 10% below its level at the start of the year. Housing market activity appears to have returned to close to normal levels, despite signs of a tightening in credit supply for some households. There is less evidence available on business spending, but surveys suggest that business investment is likely to have fallen markedly in Q2 and investment intentions remain very weak. Employment appears to have fallen since the Covid-19 outbreak, although this has been very significantly mitigated by the extensive take-up of support from temporary government schemes. Surveys indicate that many workers have already returned to work from furlough, but considerable uncertainty remains about the prospects for employment after those support schemes unwind. In the near term, the unemployment rate is projected to rise materially, to around 7½% by the end of the year, consistent with a material degree of spare capacity. In the MPC’s central projection, GDP continues to recover beyond the near term, as social distancing eases and consumer spending picks up further. Business investment also recovers, but somewhat more slowly. Unemployment declines gradually from the beginning of 2021 onwards. Activity is supported by the substantial fiscal and monetary policy actions in place. Nonetheless, the recovery in demand takes time as health concerns drag on activity. GDP is not projected to exceed its level in 2019 Q4 until the end of 2021, in part reflecting persistently weaker supply capacity. Given the scale of the movements in output, as well as the inherent uncertainty over the factors determining the outlook, the evolution of the balance between demand and supply is hard to assess. The MPC’s central projection implies that a margin of spare capacity is likely to remain until the end of next year. The risks to the outlook for GDP are judged to be skewed to the downside. Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to 0.6% in June from 0.5% in May. CPI inflation is expected to fall further below the 2% target and average around ¼% in the latter part of the year, largely reflecting the direct and indirect effects of Covid-19. These include the impact of energy prices and the temporary cut in VAT for hospitality, holiday accommodation and attractions. As these effects unwind, inflation rises, supported by a gradual strengthening of domestic price pressures as spare capacity diminishes. In the MPC’s central projection, conditioned on prevailing market yields, CPI inflation is expected to be around 2% in two years’ time. The Committee will continue to monitor the situation closely and stands ready to adjust monetary policy accordingly to meet its remit. The MPC will keep under review the range of actions that could be taken to deliver its objectives. The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. At this meeting, the Committee judges that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.

The outlook for the economy remains unusually uncertain. The MPC’s central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report assumed that the direct impact of Covid-19 on the economy would dissipate gradually. They were also conditioned on the assumption of an immediate, orderly move to a comprehensive free trade agreement with the European Union on 1 January 2021. Conditional on those assumptions, UK GDP was projected to continue to recover. Activity was also supported by substantial fiscal and monetary policy actions. Nonetheless, the recovery in demand took time as health concerns were expected to drag on activity. The unemployment rate was projected to rise markedly, consistent with a material degree of spare capacity, before declining gradually. Conditioned on prevailing market yields, CPI inflation was expected to be around 2% in two years’ time. Indicators of global activity have been broadly in line with the Committee’s expectations at the time of the August MPC meeting. The sterling exchange rate index has fallen by around 2%, in part reflecting recent Brexit developments. UK GDP in July was around 18½% above its trough in April and around 11½% below its 2019 Q4 level. High-frequency payments data suggest that consumption has continued to recover during the summer and is now at around its start-of-year level in aggregate, stronger than expected in the August Report. Investment intentions have remained very weak and uncertainties among businesses are elevated. For 2020 Q3 as a whole, Bank staff expect GDP to be around 7% below its 2019 Q4 level, less weak than had been expected in the August Report. Administrative data suggest that the number of paid employees has fallen by around 700,000 between February and August. The number of furloughed workers has continued to decline; considerable uncertainty remains around the labour market after the government job support schemes unwind. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell from 1.0% in July to 0.2% in August, consistent with temporary impacts on inflation from the Government’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme and the cut in VAT for hospitality, holiday accommodation and attractions. This triggers the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor published alongside this monetary policy announcement. CPI inflation is expected to remain below 1% until early 2021, albeit slightly higher than expected at the time of the August Report. The path of growth and inflation will depend on the evolution of the pandemic and measures taken to protect public health, as well as the nature of, and transition to, the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom. It will also depend on the responses of households, businesses and financial markets to these developments. Recent domestic economic data have been a little stronger than the Committee expected at the time of the August Report, although, given the risks, it is unclear how informative they are about how the economy will perform further out. The recent increases in Covid-19 cases in some parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, have the potential to weigh further on economic activity, albeit probably on a lesser scale than seen earlier in the year. As in the August Report, there remains a risk of a more persistent period of elevated unemployment than in the central projection. The Committee will continue to monitor the situation closely and stands ready to adjust monetary policy accordingly to meet its remit. The MPC will keep under review the range of actions that could be taken to deliver its objectives. The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. At this meeting, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.

Bank Rate held at 0.1% and asset purchases increased by £150bn - November 2020,"Bank Rate held at 0.1% and asset purchases increased by £150bn - November 2020 Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting Related links Related links Interest rates and Bank Rate Monetary Policy Report - November 2020 Published on 05 November 2020 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. In that context, its challenge at present is to respond to the economic and financial impact of the Covid pandemic. At its meeting ending on 4 November 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £20 billion. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with the existing programme of £100 billion of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, and also for the Bank of England to increase the target stock of purchased UK government bonds by an additional £150 billion, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, to take the total stock of government bond purchases to £875 billion. Since the Committee’s previous meeting, there has been a rapid rise in rates of Covid infection. The UK Government and devolved administrations have responded by increasing the severity of Covid restrictions. All restrictions announced up to and including 31 October have been reflected in the Committee’s judgements. There are signs that consumer spending has softened across a range of high-frequency indicators, while investment intentions have remained weak. The Committee’s latest projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying November Monetary Policy Report. These assume that developments related to Covid will weigh on near-term spending to a greater extent than projected in the August Report, leading to a decline in GDP in 2020 Q4. Household spending and GDP are expected to pick up in 2021 Q1, as restrictions loosen. The level of activity in the first quarter is expected to remain materially lower than in 2019 Q4. UK trade and GDP are also likely to be affected during an initial period of adjustment, over the first half of next year, as the United Kingdom leaves the Single Market and Customs Union on 1 January and is assumed to move immediately to a free trade agreement with the European Union. Over the remainder of the forecast period, GDP is projected to recover further as the direct impact of Covid on the economy is assumed to wane. Activity is also supported by the substantial fiscal policies already announced and accommodative monetary policy. The recovery takes time, however, and the risks around the GDP projection are judged to be skewed to the downside. The fall in activity over 2020 has reflected a decline in both demand and supply. Overall, there is judged to be a material amount of spare capacity in the economy. The LFS unemployment rate rose to 4.5% in the three months to August, but it is likely that labour market slack has increased by more than implied by this measure. The extended Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and new Job Support Scheme will mitigate significantly the impact of weaker economic activity on the labour market. The unemployment rate is expected to peak at around 7¾% in 2021 Q2. Beyond that point, spare capacity is expected to be eroded as activity picks up, and a small degree of excess demand emerges over the second half of the forecast period. Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to 0.5% in September, but remained well below the MPC’s 2% target, largely reflecting the direct and indirect effects of Covid on the economy. These include the temporary impact of lower energy prices and the reduction in VAT, as well as some downward pressure from spare capacity. CPI inflation is expected to remain at, or just above, ½% during most of the winter, before rising quite sharply towards the target as the effects of lower energy prices and VAT dissipate. In the central projection, conditioned on prevailing asset prices, inflation is projected to be 2% in two years’ time. The outlook for the economy remains unusually uncertain. It depends on the evolution of the pandemic and measures taken to protect public health, as well as the nature of, and transition to, the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom. It also depends on the responses of households, businesses and financial markets to these developments. At this meeting, the MPC judges that a further easing of monetary policy is warranted. The Committee agreed to increase the target stock of purchased UK government bonds by an additional £150 billion in order to meet the inflation target in the medium term, taking the total stock of government bond purchases to £875 billion. The Committee will keep the asset purchase programme under review. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely. If the outlook for inflation weakens, the Committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve its remit. The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably.

At its meeting ending on 16 December 2020, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%.

The MPC’s central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report assumed that the pandemic would weigh on near-term spending to a greater extent than projected in the August Report, given new restrictions announced in October in response to rising virus cases. They were also conditioned on the assumption that the United Kingdom, after leaving the Single Market and Customs Union on 1 January 2021, moved immediately to a free trade agreement with the European Union. Conditional on those assumptions, UK GDP was projected to decline in 2020 Q4, and then pick up as restrictions were assumed to loosen. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate was projected to rise markedly, consistent with a material degree of spare capacity, before declining gradually. Conditioned on prevailing market yields, CPI inflation was expected to be around 2% in two years’ time. The main news since the November Report has been the successful trialling of some Covid vaccines and initial plans to roll them out widely over the first half of next year. This is likely to reduce the downside risks to the economic outlook from Covid previously identified by the Committee. Financial markets worldwide, and some surveys of businesses and consumers, have reacted positively to these developments which are likely to support future UK and global activity. Nevertheless, recent global activity has been affected by the increase in Covid cases and associated re-imposition of restrictions. UK-weighted global GDP growth in 2020 Q4 is likely to be a little weaker than expected at the time of the November Report. The near-term UK outlook has evolved broadly in line with the Committee’s expectations in the November Report. UK GDP grew by 0.4% in October, leaving it 8% below its level in 2019 Q4. Activity has been stronger than expected, despite the recent rise in Covid cases and associated lockdowns. Nevertheless, the restrictions on activity introduced after those lockdowns have been tighter than the Committee had assumed in its November forecast, and are expected to weigh more on activity in 2021 Q1. The successful rollout of vaccines should support the gradual removal of restrictions and rebound in activity that was assumed in the November Report, although it is less clear how this prospect will affect the immediate economic behaviour of households and businesses. The additional fiscal measures in Spending Review 2020 are likely to boost GDP by an estimated peak of over 1% during 2021-22. Developments in the labour market have remained difficult to interpret. The LFS unemployment rate rose to 4.9% in the three months to October, but other indicators suggest that labour market slack has increased by more than implied by this measure. The extension of the government’s employment support schemes is likely to limit significantly the near-term rise in unemployment, although a substantial further increase is still likely over the next few quarters. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 0.3% in November, from 0.7% in October, triggering the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor published alongside this monetary policy announcement. The weakness of recent outturns largely reflects the direct and indirect effects of Covid on the economy. CPI inflation is expected to rise quite sharply towards the target in the spring, as the VAT cut comes to an end and the large fall in energy prices earlier this year drops out of the annual comparison. The outlook for the economy remains unusually uncertain. It depends on the evolution of the pandemic and measures taken to protect public health, as well as the nature of, and transition to, the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom. It will also depend on the responses of households, businesses and financial markets to these developments. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely.

At its meeting ending on 3 February 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £20 billion. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at £895 billion. The Committee’s projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying February Monetary Policy Report. Covid-19 (Covid) vaccination programmes are under way in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, which has improved the economic outlook. Nevertheless, recent UK and global activity has been affected by an increase in Covid cases, including from newly identified strains of the virus, and the associated reimposition of restrictions. The United Kingdom and European Union also announced a trade agreement, which has applied since 1 January 2021. Global GDP growth slowed in 2020 Q4, as a rise in Covid cases and consequent restrictions to contain the spread of the virus weighed on economic activity. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, financial markets have remained resilient. UK GDP is expected to have risen a little in 2020 Q4 to a level around 8% lower than in 2019 Q4. This is materially stronger than expected in the November Report. While the scale and breadth of the Covid restrictions in place at present mean that they are expected to affect activity more than those in 2020 Q4, their impact is not expected to be as severe as in 2020 Q2, during the United Kingdom’s first lockdown. GDP is expected to fall by around 4% in 2021 Q1, in contrast to expectations of a rise in the November Report. Labour market indicators remain difficult to interpret. The LFS unemployment rate rose to 5.0% in the three months to November, but other indicators suggest that labour market slack has remained higher than implied by this measure. The Government’s employment support schemes are likely to limit significantly the immediate rise in unemployment. A further increase in unemployment is projected over the next few quarters. Average Weekly Earnings growth has been notably stronger than expected in the November Report, although this may overstate underlying pay growth. GDP is projected to recover rapidly towards pre-Covid levels over 2021, as the vaccination programme is assumed to lead to an easing of Covid-related restrictions and people’s health concerns. Projected activity is also supported by the substantial fiscal and monetary policy actions already announced. Further out, the pace of GDP growth slows as the boost from these factors fades. Spare capacity in the economy is eliminated as activity picks up during 2021. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 0.3% in November to 0.6% in December. The weakness of recent outturns largely reflects the direct and indirect effects of Covid on the economy. CPI inflation is expected to rise quite sharply towards the 2% target in the spring, as the reduction in VAT for certain services comes to an end and given developments in energy prices. In the MPC’s central projection, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, CPI inflation is projected to be close to 2% over the second and third years of the forecast period. The outlook for the economy remains unusually uncertain. It depends on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond to these developments. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely. If the outlook for inflation weakens, the Committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve its remit.

At its meeting ending on 17 March 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%.

The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at £895 billion. The MPC’s central projections in the February Monetary Policy Report assumed that Covid-related restrictions and people’s health concerns would weigh on activity in the near term, but that the vaccination programme would lead to those easing, such that UK GDP was projected to recover strongly over 2021 towards pre-Covid levels. At the time of the Report, a further increase in unemployment had been projected over the next couple of quarters. CPI inflation was expected to return towards the 2% target in the spring and, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, it was projected to be close to 2% over the second and third years of the forecast period. Since the time of that forecast, developments in global GDP growth have been a little stronger than anticipated, and the substantial new US fiscal stimulus package should provide significant additional support to the outlook. In part reflecting this and alongside positive news on some vaccination programmes, advanced economy longer-term government bond yields have risen rapidly to levels similar to those seen shortly before the pandemic. For the most part this has reflected higher real yields. Risky asset prices have remained resilient. In the United Kingdom, the sterling effective exchange rate has appreciated and mortgage credit conditions have eased a little. An aggregate measure of UK financial conditions has been broadly unchanged since the February Report. The rates of Covid infections and hospitalisations have fallen markedly across the United Kingdom and the vaccination programme is proceeding at a rapid pace. Plans for the easing of restrictions on activity have been announced and envisage that restrictions could be lifted somewhat more rapidly than was assumed in the February Report. Budget 2021, published in March, contained a number of significant new policy announcements, including the extension of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and other measures to support the economy in the near term which had not been reflected in the February Report. UK GDP fell by 2.9% in January. This was less weak than expected, due mainly to developments in public sector output, but still leaves GDP around 10% below its 2019 Q4 level. The news in recent plans for the easing of restrictions on activity may be consistent with a slightly stronger outlook for consumption growth in 2021 Q2 than was anticipated in the February Report, although it is less clear that this represents news to the MPC’s medium-term forecast. The LFS unemployment rate rose to 5.1% in the three months to December, but it is likely that labour market slack has remained higher than implied by this measure. The extension of the Government’s employment support schemes is likely to mean that the near-term rise in the LFS unemployment rate will be more moderate than suggested by the MPC’s February Report projections, which had been constructed on the basis of existing government policy at that time. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose slightly to 0.7% in January. The weakness of recent outturns has largely reflected the direct and indirect effects of Covid on the economy, in particular the decline in oil prices seen in early 2020. As has been the case in recent MPC projections, CPI inflation is expected to return swiftly to around the 2% target in the spring, as the effects of those earlier falls in oil prices drop out of the annual comparison, and reflecting more recent increases in energy prices. These developments should have few direct implications for inflation over the medium term, however. Inflation expectations remain well anchored. There is judged to be a material degree of spare capacity at present. The outlook for the economy, and particularly the relative movement in demand and supply during the recovery from the pandemic, remains unusually uncertain. It continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond to these developments. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely. If the outlook for inflation weakens, the Committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve its remit.

At its meeting ending on 5 May 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £20 billion. The Committee voted by a majority of 8-1 for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at £895 billion. Covid-19 (Covid) and the actions taken to contain it have continued to have a dramatic and rapidly changing impact on the United Kingdom and countries around the world. The Committee’s updated projections for economic activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying May Monetary Policy Report. Global GDP growth is likely to have slowed in 2021 Q1 as Covid-related restrictions weighed on economic activity, although growth appears to have been stronger than expected in the February Report. Covid vaccination programmes have progressed and picked up pace in many countries. Recently, however, new Covid cases have increased significantly in India and some other economies, leading to tighter restrictions. Advanced-economy risky asset prices have continued to increase and longer-term government bond yields have stabilised since March, such that they are higher than at the time of the February Report. UK GDP is expected to have fallen by around 1½% in 2021 Q1, less weak than was assumed in the February Report. New Covid cases in the United Kingdom have continued to fall, the vaccination programme is proceeding apace, and restrictions on economic activity are easing. Reflecting these developments, GDP is expected to rise sharply in 2021 Q2, although activity in that quarter is likely to remain on average around 5% below its level in 2019 Q4. GDP is expected to recover strongly to pre-Covid levels over the remainder of this year in the absence of most restrictions on domestic economic activity. Demand growth is further boosted by a decline in health risks and a fall in uncertainty, as well as announced fiscal and monetary stimulus. Consumer spending is also supported by households running down over the next three years around 10% of their additional accumulated savings. After 2021, the pace of GDP growth is expected to slow as the boost from some of those factors wanes. The level of activity is higher in each quarter of the forecast than in the February projections. The fall in activity over the past year has reflected a decline in both demand and supply. The LFS unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.9% in the three months to February, but it is likely that labour market slack has remained higher than implied by this measure. Overall, there is judged to be spare capacity in the economy at present. The extension of the Government’s employment support schemes in Budget 2021 is expected to limit significantly the near-term rise in the LFS unemployment rate. The MPC also expects the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment to rise by less than was forecast in February. Spare capacity is eliminated as activity picks up during 2021, and there is a temporary period of excess demand, before demand and supply return broadly to balance. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 0.4% in February to 0.7% in March, with the February outturn triggering the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor published alongside this monetary policy announcement. The weakness of recent CPI outturns has largely reflected the direct and indirect effects of Covid on the economy. As has been the case in recent MPC forecasts, inflation is projected to rise to close to the target in the near term as some of those effects fade. In the central projection, CPI inflation rises temporarily above the 2% target towards the end of 2021, owing mainly to developments in energy prices. These transitory developments should have few direct implications for inflation over the medium term, however. In the central projection, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, inflation returns to around 2% in the medium term. The outlook for the economy, and particularly the relative movement in demand and supply, remains uncertain. It continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond to these developments. In the central projections of the MPC’s May Report, the economy experiences a temporary period of strong GDP growth and a temporary period of modestly above-target CPI inflation, after which growth and inflation fall back, with inflation around the target two and three years ahead. In judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will, consistent with its policy guidance and as always, focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including the balance between demand and supply, rather than factors that are likely to be transient. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely and will take whatever action is necessary to achieve its remit. The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. At this meeting, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate.

The Committee voted by a majority of 8-1 for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at £895 billion. In the MPC’s central projection in the May Monetary Policy Report, UK GDP was expected to recover strongly over 2021, to pre-Covid-19 (Covid) levels. Spare capacity in the economy was expected to be eliminated as activity picked up, and there was expected to be a temporary period of excess demand, before demand and supply returned broadly to balance. CPI inflation was projected to rise temporarily above the 2% target, owing mainly to developments in energy prices. As these transitory effects faded, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, inflation was expected to return to around 2% in the medium term. Since May, developments in global GDP growth have been somewhat stronger than anticipated, particularly in advanced economies. Global price pressures have picked up further, reflecting strong demand for goods, rising commodity prices, supply-side constraints and transportation bottlenecks, and these have started to become apparent in consumer price inflation in some advanced economies. Financial market measures of inflation expectations suggest that the near-term strength in inflation is expected to be transitory. Bank staff have revised up their expectations for the level of UK GDP in 2021 Q2 by around 1½% since the May Report, as restrictions on economic activity have eased, so that output in June is expected to be around 2½% below its pre-Covid 2019 Q4 level. This recovery in activity has been most pronounced in the consumer-facing services for which restrictions were loosened in April. Output in a number of sectors is now around pre-Covid levels, although it remains materially below in others. The housing market remains strong, and indicators of consumer confidence have increased. The direct economic implications of the delays in the final stages of the relaxation of Covid restrictions are likely to be relatively small compared with the impact of previous stages. The LFS unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.7% in the three months to April, although it is likely that labour market slack has remained higher than implied by this measure. Some individuals stopped looking for work during the pandemic, and were therefore recorded as inactive. There is uncertainty around how many of these individuals will resume their search for a job, and when. The number of furloughed jobs has declined faster than expected, as demand has recovered. Overall, there is judged to be spare capacity in aggregate in the economy at present. However, vacancies have risen above pre-Covid levels, and there are increasing signs of recruitment difficulties for some businesses, and in some locations and sectors. Private sector regular pay in the three months to April was 5.6% higher than a year earlier. Measured pay growth continues to be boosted by compositional effects, given that job losses have been skewed towards lower-paid employees during the pandemic. In addition, the base effect of the drop in pay in spring and summer 2020 will continue to distort the annual comparison, such that, even if the level of private sector regular pay were to remain unchanged in May and June, twelve-month pay growth would still rise to close to 8% in the second quarter. Underlying pay growth appears to be around pre-Covid rates. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 1.5% in April to 2.1% in May, above the MPC’s 2% target and 0.3 percentage points higher than expected in the May Report. Core CPI inflation has also risen from 1.3% to 2.0%. Building global input cost pressures have increasingly been passed through into manufacturing output prices and non-oil import prices. CPI inflation is expected to pick up further above the target, owing primarily to developments in energy and other commodity prices, and is likely to exceed 3% for a temporary period. The Committee’s expectation is that the direct impact of rises in commodity prices on CPI inflation will be transitory. More generally, the Committee’s central expectation is that the economy will experience a temporary period of strong GDP growth and above-target CPI inflation, after which growth and inflation will fall back. There are two-sided risks around this central path, and it is possible that near-term upward pressure on prices could prove somewhat larger than expected. Taking together the evidence from financial market measures and surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters, the Committee judges that UK inflation expectations remain well anchored. In judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will, consistent with its policy guidance and as always, focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including the balance between demand and supply, and medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that are likely to be transient. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely and will take whatever action is necessary to achieve its remit. The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. The Committee will have the opportunity to assess the economic outlook more fully in the context of its August Monetary Policy Report and accompanying economic projections. At this meeting, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate.

Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 4 August 2021 ( PDF 0.5MB) PDF Close dialog Published on 05 August 2021 Monetary Policy Summary, August 2021 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 4 August 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £20 billion. The Committee voted by a majority of 7-1 for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at £895 billion. The Committee’s updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report . They assume that, despite the spread of the Delta variant, the impact of Covid on the UK economy fades further over time. They are also conditioned on the market path for interest rates. Global GDP growth is estimated to have risen sharply in 2021 Q2, as Covid vaccination programmes gathered pace and restrictions were eased further. Partly reflecting the spread of the Delta variant, global growth in Q3 is expected to expand at a slower pace than anticipated in the May Report. Global price pressures have continued to build, reflecting the speed and unevenness of the recovery in activity, and disruptions to supply chains. UK GDP is expected to have risen by 5% in 2021 Q2, leaving it around 4% below its pre-pandemic level and slightly stronger than expected in the May Report. After the MPC’s previous meeting, the number of Covid cases continued to rise but has subsequently shown signs of falling back, although there has been a sharp increase in the number of people being asked to self-isolate temporarily. The majority of remaining domestic Covid restrictions have now been lifted. Faster indicators of household spending have been broadly flat, at close to pre-Covid levels, but the housing market has remained strong. GDP is expected to grow by around 3% in Q3, somewhat weaker than expected in the May Report, with a small negative impact from recent developments in the pandemic. UK GDP is projected to recover further over the remainder of the year, reaching its pre-pandemic level in 2021 Q4, with demand growth boosted by a waning impact from Covid. Further out, the pace of GDP growth is expected to slow towards more normal rates, partly reflecting the gradual tightening in the stance of announced fiscal policy. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate was 4.8% in the three months to May, 1 percentage point higher than at the end of 2019. The inactivity rate was also 1 percentage point above its level at the end of 2019. The number of full and part-time furloughed jobs has continued to decline as demand has recovered, but remained at around 2 million at the end of June. The stock of vacancies has increased further, as have indicators of recruitment difficulties. There appear to have been difficulties in matching available jobs and workers. These frictions are for a period reducing effective supply in the economy. Overall, the MPC judges that spare capacity has been eroded over the past couple of quarters, as demand has outstripped growth in effective supply. Frictions in the labour market are judged likely to dissipate over the forecast period, boosting growth in effective supply capacity. There is uncertainty around these judgements, including how the economy will adjust to the end of the furlough scheme. Private sector regular pay in the three months to May was over 7% higher than a year earlier, and annual growth is projected to have peaked at around 8½% in 2021 Q2. Adjusted for the impact of the furlough scheme, the changing composition of employment during the pandemic and annual base effects, underlying pay growth appears to continue to be around pre-Covid rates. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose to 2.5% in June, above the MPC’s 2% target and 0.8 percentage points higher than expected in the May Report. Core CPI inflation has also risen further, to 2.3%, as building global input cost pressures have been passed through to some consumer goods prices and, to a lesser degree, the reopening of the economy has led to a pickup in some consumer services and goods prices. CPI inflation is projected to rise temporarily in the near term, to 4% in 2021 Q4, owing largely to developments in energy and other goods prices, before falling back to close to the 2% target. The Committee’s central expectation is that current elevated global and domestic cost pressures will prove transitory. Nonetheless, the economy is projected to experience a more pronounced period of above-target inflation in the near term than expected in the May Report. And, alongside temporary constraints on supply, the rapid recovery in demand has eroded spare capacity such that the economy is projected to have a margin of excess demand for a period. In the medium term, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, inflation is projected to fall back to close to the 2% target, and demand and supply are expected to return broadly to balance. The MPC has had policy guidance in place specifying that it does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. Some members of the Committee judge that, although considerable progress has been made in achieving the conditions of that guidance, the conditions are not yet met fully. The other members judge that the conditions of the guidance have been met fully, but note that the guidance made clear that these have only ever been necessary not sufficient conditions for any future tightening in monetary policy. All members confirm that in judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will, as always, focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that are likely to be transient. In particular, the Committee will not put undue weight on capacity pressures that are frictional in nature and likely to be temporary. The Committee will be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding developments in the labour market, and particularly unemployment, wider measures of slack and underlying wage pressures. In addition, there remain two-sided risks around the central path for inflation in the medium term. Risk management considerations continue to have some force. The Committee judges that, should the economy evolve broadly in line with the central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report , some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period is likely to be necessary to be consistent with meeting the inflation target sustainably in the medium term. At this meeting, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 4 August 2021 1) Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the backdrop of its latest economic projections, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2) UK-weighted global GDP growth was estimated to have risen sharply in 2021 Q2, as Covid vaccination programmes had gathered pace and restrictions had eased further. Growth in Q2 was likely to have been somewhat stronger than projected in the May Monetary Policy Report . Partly reflecting the spread of the Delta variant, global GDP in Q3 was expected to expand at a slower pace than had been anticipated in the May Report. 3) Global price pressures had continued to build, reflecting the speed and unevenness of the recovery in global activity, supply chain disruptions, and some shortages of inputs. Some of these factors were likely to be transitory and could subsequently unwind. There had been further sharp increases in manufacturing output prices and non-oil commodity prices had also risen a little recently. The Brent oil spot price had fallen slightly since the MPC’s previous meeting, however, to around $72 per barrel, with the increased production announced by OPEC+ members on 18 July having pushed down somewhat on prices. Shipping costs had increased further, although disruption at major Chinese ports had been easing and global containerised trade flows had continued to rise. 4) These factors had combined with strong demand for certain goods and services to push consumer price inflation higher in many advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs) in recent months. In the United States, core PCE inflation had ticked up to 3.5% in June, while the headline measure had remained unchanged at 4.0%. In the euro area, headline HICP inflation had increased somewhat in July, to 2.2%, although the core measure had fallen a little to 0.7%. Headline inflation in these regions was expected to fall somewhat in coming quarters, as some of the previous rises had reflected factors that were likely to be temporary, such as the contribution of energy prices and sector-specific supply and demand mismatches. In China, by contrast, consumer price inflation had remained subdued, although producer price inflation had picked up sharply. 5) According to the preliminary flash estimate, euro-area GDP had grown by 2.0% in 2021 Q2, following a slight fall in Q1. This Q2 outturn was stronger than expected at the time of the MPC’s previous meeting, although it still left the level of GDP around 3% lower than immediately before the pandemic, in 2019 Q4. Led by the service sector, the euro-area composite output PMI had risen further in July, to 60.2, and the European Commission’s business confidence survey balances had also picked up again. The euro-area unemployment rate had fallen by 0.3 percentage points to 7.7% in June. Recent news on the spread of the Delta variant was likely to push down on GDP growth in Q3 compared with previous assumptions. 6) According to the advance estimate, US GDP had increased by 1.6% in 2021 Q2. This was slightly weaker than expected at the time of the MPC’s previous meeting, but it had been sufficient to raise the level of GDP back above its pre-Covid peak. Within this, household spending had continued to grow robustly, with services consumption having accelerated but goods consumption growth having slowed. In the labour market, the unemployment rate was little changed at 5.9% in June, but inactivity had remained persistently high, and there were signs of elevated mismatch, with a high level of vacancies despite unemployment remaining well above its pre-Covid rate. Recent news on the spread of the Delta variant was likely to weigh on GDP growth in Q3, although mobility indices and internet searches related to social spending suggested that the impact on US economic activity was likely to be smaller than in other major advanced economies. 7) In China, GDP growth had picked up to 1.3% in 2021 Q2, in line with expectations at the time of the MPC’s previous meeting, following a relatively weak expansion of 0.4% in Q1. Covid-related restrictions imposed in Guangdong province in May and June appeared to have had a fairly limited impact on aggregate economic activity. Monthly data for June had suggested some rebalancing towards private domestic demand, with retail sales and manufacturing investment strengthening, albeit with property investment moderating. 8) In a number of large EMEs, there had been a sharp increase in Covid cases recently. The latest business surveys had nevertheless pointed to a mixed picture across countries, with manufacturing PMIs for July recovering in India and Turkey, but falling sharply in South Africa and Indonesia. The rollout of vaccines in EMEs continued to have been generally more limited than in many advanced economies. Given this, aggregate growth in large EMEs appeared likely to slow somewhat in the third quarter, and the economic impact from the spread of the Delta variant was expected to be more persistent than in advanced economies. 9) The Committee discussed any lessons that could be learned from the economic experience of countries that had taken earlier steps to relax Covid restrictions than the United Kingdom, such as Australia, New Zealand and Israel. None of these countries provided an exact parallel to the United Kingdom’s situation, and each had had different experiences of the virus and policy responses. There were nevertheless some noteworthy features. Household savings had tended to decline from elevated rates after restrictions were lifted, but had not fallen materially below their pre-Covid levels, suggesting that there had been no rapid run-down of involuntarily accumulated savings. There had been only a gradual normalisation in the composition of consumer demand, with demand for durable goods remaining high as demand for services recovered. Governments in Australia and New Zealand appeared to have been able to withdraw support from the labour market without a sharp increase in unemployment. Monetary and financial conditions 10) Advanced-economy longer-term government bond yields had fallen since the MPC’s previous meeting, reversing some of the increases seen earlier in the year. The main drivers of these movements appeared to have been increased concerns about Covid-related risks to the global growth outlook. The falls in yields had been accounted for primarily by real rates, with inflation compensation components having been broadly stable. 11) Market-implied measures of advanced-economy policy rates had fallen a little since the MPC’s previous meeting. At its meeting on 22 July, the ECB Governing Council had left its key policy interest rates and the scale and pace of its asset purchase programmes unchanged. The Governing Council had earlier published its new monetary policy strategy, on 8 July, which had included the adoption of a symmetric 2% inflation target over the medium term. The conclusions of the strategy review had been largely in line with market expectations. At its 28 July meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee had left unchanged its target range for the federal funds rate and the pace of asset purchases. 12) The market-implied path for Bank Rate that underpinned the August Monetary Policy Report projections rose to around 0.5% at the MPC’s three-year forecast horizon, little changed from the May Report. 13) Movements in risky asset prices since the MPC’s previous meeting had been mixed. US equity prices had increased, but in the United Kingdom and euro area, they had been little changed. Although the fall in government bond yields had supported equity prices, equity risk premia had risen in all regions, possibly reflecting a perceived increase in the risk posed by Covid to the economic outlook. Equity prices related to companies in industries that had been most exposed to Covid, such as airlines, had continued to underperform headline indices. 14) The sterling effective exchange rate had been broadly stable since the previous MPC meeting. 15) Credit supply conditions for households had loosened since the Committee’s previous meeting, particularly for mortgage lending, for which much of the tightening that had occurred since the onset of the pandemic had unwound. Spreads on fixed-term mortgages had continued to fall. Net secured lending to households had risen to an all-time high of £17.9 billion in June. This strength was in large part due to an elevated number of property transactions completing before the tapering in July of the temporary stamp duty threshold in England and Northern Ireland, and the removal of the similar tax change in Wales. The net flow of consumer credit had continued to be slightly positive in June, having edged up gradually over the previous few months. 16) While credit conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises had tightened in 2021 Q2 with the ending of some government lending schemes, conditions for the corporate sector overall had been little changed, and were looser than expected in the May Report. Demand and output 17) UK GDP was estimated to have risen by 0.8% in May, slightly weaker than had been expected by Bank staff immediately prior to the release. Within this, consumer-facing services output had increased by around 5% on the month, reflecting the reopening of indoor hospitality and non-self-contained accommodation. Private business-to-business services, construction and manufacturing output in May had been weaker than expected, however. In particular, there had been some evidence of global supply chain disruptions weighing on UK activity, with a shortage of semiconductor microchips leading to a sharp fall in car production. For the second quarter as a whole, Bank staff continued to expect GDP to have been slightly stronger than forecast at the time of the May Monetary Policy Report . The August Report projections incorporated 2021 Q2 quarterly growth of 5%, which would have left GDP around 4% below its level in 2019 Q4, prior to the pandemic. 18) After the MPC’s previous meeting, the number of Covid cases had continued to increase but had subsequently shown signs of falling back, although there had been a sharp increase in the number of people asked to self-isolate temporarily through various channels. The number of hospitalisations of Covid patients and, in particular, deaths within 28 days of testing positive for Covid had risen to a lesser degree than during previous waves of the pandemic. The vaccination programme had continued. The majority of remaining domestic Covid restrictions had been lifted in England on 19 July, and were planned to be relaxed to a similar degree in Wales on 7 August and in Scotland on 9 August. Restrictions in Northern Ireland had been lifted progressively in late July. 19) Having picked up strongly in April and May, immediately following the reopening of the economy, faster indicators of household spending, such as CHAPS payments data, had been broadly flat in June and July, at levels close to those immediately before the pandemic. Measures of consumer confidence had also stabilised. Official retail sales volumes had risen by 0.5% in June, following a 1.3% fall in May, and leaving the level of sales around 9% above its 2019 Q4 level. Private new car registrations had risen slightly in June, to around their pre-pandemic levels. 20) Residential property transactions had picked up significantly in June, to 198,000 from 114,000 in May, as buyers had completed transactions before the tapering in July of the temporary stamp duty threshold in England and Northern Ireland, and the removal of the similar tax change in Wales. The number of mortgage approvals for house purchase had fallen slightly in June, however, to 81,300. The UK house price index had risen by 0.5% in May, taking the inflation rate in the three months to May compared to the same period a year earlier to around 10%. Timelier indicators had suggested some ongoing strength in house price inflation in the near term, with surveys and intelligence from the Bank’s Agents continuing to point to demand running ahead of supply. 21) The ONS Business Insights and Conditions Survey suggested that the share of UK companies open for trading had increased slightly further since the MPC’s previous meeting, although that share appeared to have stabilised at around 90% in the most recent data. There had been tentative signs that rising Covid cases and the number of individuals self-isolating had affected workplace mobility in some areas. Evidence from both manufacturing and services PMI surveys suggested that there remained substantial backlogs of work. The Bank’s Agents had also reported constraints on output from frictions in both global and domestic supply chains, shortages of heavy goods vehicle delivery drivers and restrictions in labour supply. Official trade data for May had continued to show that goods imports from the European Union had been weaker than imports from non-EU countries. 22) Companies’ expectations of the near-term impact of Covid on business investment had been at similar levels in the July Decision Maker Panel survey as in the May survey that the Committee had had available at its previous meeting. Firms expected investment in 2021 Q3 to be around 6% lower than it would otherwise have been, and around 3% lower in 2021 Q4. Agency contacts had reported that companies in several sectors were expecting to resume investment projects that had been put on hold during the pandemic, particularly in sectors in which demand was outpacing capacity. 23) Overall, GDP was expected to grow by around 3% in 2021 Q3 in the August Report projection, compared with just over 4% in the May Report. Despite the upside news in activity anticipated for the second quarter, this meant that the level of GDP was projected to be slightly lower in the third quarter than at the time of the May Report, with a small negative impact expected from recent developments in the pandemic. 24) The Committee discussed the risks around the near-term outlook for GDP. The impact of the Delta variant could, against a counterfactual of stronger growth, already be having a larger negative impact on activity than the Committee was assuming, including via voluntary social distancing. If the recent moderation in Covid cases persisted then that could lead to stronger-than-expected growth further out, however. And it was not clear to what extent voluntary social distancing was affecting spending at an aggregate level if consumption could now be substituted away more easily from activities considered riskier from a health perspective. But some levelling off in many indicators of spending had occurred before the latest pickup in cases and so it was also possible that the flattening in consumer spending over recent months had simply reflected an easing of the initial release of pent-up demand. This had also been observed in countries that had reopened earlier than the United Kingdom. Supply, costs and prices 25) The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen from 5.2% in 2020 Q4 to 4.8% in the three months to May, although it had remained 1 percentage point higher than at the end of 2019. The LFS inactivity rate was also around 1 percentage point higher than it had been before the pandemic. LFS responses since the beginning of 2020 had been reweighted using population weights informed by HMRC payrolls data. The revised LFS estimates were now consistent with a broadly stable population aged 16 and over, and had shown a slightly steeper decrease in the employment rate relative to earlier estimates for the period. HMRC payroll figures had continued to show a much steeper decline in the number of employees during 2020 than implied by the LFS, but had also shown a sharper recovery since the turn of the year. The HMRC series had increased by around a further 350,000 between May and June, although it was still around 200,000 lower than in February 2020. 26) The number of jobs furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) had fallen by around 600,000 during June, to just under 1.9 million by the end of the month, equivalent to around 8% of private sector jobs. The latest data from the ONS Business Insights and Conditions Survey, scaled to match the administrative estimates, had suggested that around 6% of private sector jobs were furloughed in the first half of July, of which 55% of these jobs were held by employees on a flexible form of furlough that allowed them to have undertaken some work with their employer. The proportion of salary for furloughed hours covered by the government had been tapered from 80% to 70% in July and to 60% from 1 August, with employers required to top up to 80%. 27) The increases in unemployment, inactivity and the number of jobs furloughed since the onset of the pandemic suggested a material amount of labour market slack. Other indicators pointed to the labour market having been tighter, however. The stock of vacancies had increased further in June, to almost 20% above its 2019 average, such that the single-month ratio of vacancies to unemployment had returned to its level in early 2020. The latest Bank’s Agents’ score for recruitment difficulties had also risen sharply to close to its pre-pandemic level, and the index of staff availability in the REC Report on Jobs had reached a record low in June. The speed and scale of the recovery in labour demand had contributed to increasing recruitment difficulties. In addition, there appeared to have been difficulties in matching available jobs and workers, perhaps reflecting disparities across geographical areas. In recent weeks, some of the Agents’ contacts had also reported a significant number of employees self-isolating for a period, contributing to temporary labour shortages. 28) Private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had risen by 7.2% in the three months to May on a year earlier, and the annual rate was projected to have peaked at around 8½% in 2021 Q2 in the August Monetary Policy Report forecast. Annual AWE growth rates had been boosted by base effects, reflecting the marked drop in pay in 2020 Q2. The recent strength had also reflected significant compositional effects, with the jobs lost during the pandemic skewed towards lower-paid roles. Adjusted for the effects of the CJRS and changes in composition, Bank staff estimated that private sector regular pay had risen by an annualised rate of 2¾% since 2019 Q4, including 4% annualised growth in the first half of this year, the latter of which was around the rates seen prior to the pandemic. There was a lot of uncertainty around these estimates, however. The Agents had also reported a pickup in pay settlements, and signs of pay pressures emerging more broadly, with a number of contacts reviewing pay structures or giving targeted pay increases or bonuses. 29) Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 2.1% in May to 2.5% in June, 0.8 percentage points higher than projected in the May Report. Similarly, core CPI inflation, excluding food, beverages, tobacco and energy, had risen from 2.0% to 2.3%. The bulk of the news had been in core goods components, such as cars and clothing and footwear, with some additional upside news in services, and catering prices in particular, and to a lesser degree energy prices. Goods prices had increased globally, reflecting strong demand for goods and supply shortages. Some of the recent strength in CPI inflation might have also been related to the initial reopening of some sectors of the economy. 30) CPI inflation was projected to rise further in the near term, to around 4% in 2021 Q4. Almost half of the projected increase was accounted for by higher energy price inflation. At the same time, core CPI inflation was projected to rise to around 3%. The Agents’ contacts had reported further increases in the costs of a wide range of materials and commodities, and higher-than-usual freight and warehousing costs, with such costs having been passed through to consumer prices to a greater extent than earlier in the year. Price and cost indicators, such as the manufacturing input and output PMIs, had remained high since the MPC’s June meeting, and in some cases had strengthened further, posing a potential upside risk to the short-term inflation forecast alongside increasing labour cost pressures. UK import prices had picked up less strongly than these other cost measures would suggest, however, albeit by more than might have been expected given developments in world export prices and the sterling exchange rate. To the extent that CPI inflation had been boosted initially by the lifting of restrictions, there was the potential for such inflationary pressures to moderate as demand settled down. 31) Companies’ expectations of inflation one and two years ahead had increased, according to a range of business surveys, including the latest Deloitte CFO and CBI surveys and the July Decision Maker Panel. One-year ahead financial market and professional forecasters’ inflation expectations had also risen in 2021 Q2, and the Citi/YouGov measure of household one-year ahead inflation expectations had risen in July, having fallen a little in Q2. Short-term household measures tended to be correlated with inflation outturns, so it was possible that they would increase somewhat further alongside the expected rise in CPI inflation over the coming months. Medium-term measures of inflation expectations were expected to be more stable in the face of a temporary shock to inflation. The Citi/YouGov five-year ahead measure of inflation expectations had remained unchanged in July. Medium-term financial market measures of UK inflation compensation, such as the five-year inflation swap rate, five years forward, had been broadly stable since the MPC’s previous meeting, at a little above their average levels over the previous decade. The immediate policy decision 32) The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 33) The Committee reviewed recent developments against the backdrop of its latest economic projections as set out in the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report . Those projections assumed that, despite the spread of the Delta variant, the impact of Covid on the UK economy faded further over time. They were also conditioned on the market path for interest rates. 34) Global GDP growth was estimated to have risen sharply in 2021 Q2, as Covid vaccination programmes had gathered pace and restrictions had been eased further. Partly reflecting the spread of the Delta variant, global GDP in Q3 was expected to expand at a slower pace than had been anticipated in the May Report. In the August Report projections, UK-weighted world GDP continued to rise robustly in the near term, as the impact of Covid continued to wane, supported by vaccination programmes. The pace of the expansion in global GDP slowed over 2022, with growth returning to around pre-Covid rates in the latter years of the forecast period. 35) Global price pressures had continued to build, reflecting the speed and unevenness of the recovery in activity, and disruptions to supply chains. These developments had been reflected in world export price inflation, which had picked up sharply. Such trends could persist for a period, particularly if supply chains were vulnerable to further Covid-related disruptions. The strength in global inflationary pressures was expected to be transitory in the Committee’s central projections, however. And it was possible that price pressures could prove to be weaker than expected in the medium term, as previous periods of elevated tradable goods prices had often been followed by periods of relatively low inflation, possibly because supply had adjusted only with a lag. 36) Advanced-economy longer-term government bond yields had fallen since the MPC’s previous meeting, possibly reflecting concerns about Covid-related risks to global growth. The falls in yields had been accounted for primarily by real rates, with inflation compensation components having been broadly stable. Movements in risky asset prices globally had been mixed. Credit supply conditions for UK households had loosened, particularly for mortgage lending, for which much of the tightening that had occurred since the onset of the pandemic had unwound. 37) As of 4 August 2021, the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility had reached £845 billion, including £100 billion of the £150 billion programme of UK government bond purchases announced on 5 November 2020. 38) UK GDP was expected to have risen by 5% in 2021 Q2, leaving it around 4% below its pre-pandemic level and slightly stronger than expected in the May Report. 39) After the MPC’s previous meeting, the number of Covid cases in the United Kingdom had continued to rise but had subsequently shown signs of falling back, although there had been a sharp increase in the number of people being asked to self-isolate temporarily. The majority of remaining domestic Covid restrictions had now been lifted. 40) Faster indicators of household spending had been broadly flat, at close to pre-Covid levels, but the housing market had remained strong. There was some evidence of constraints on output from frictions in supply chains, and restrictions in labour supply. GDP was expected to grow by around 3% in 2021 Q3, somewhat weaker than expected in the May Report, with a small negative impact from recent developments in the pandemic. In the near term, the risks to GDP were judged to be skewed to the downside of the central forecast, as there could be an impact on UK and global activity from a renewed rise in Covid cases, especially if any new variants of the virus emerged for which vaccine efficacy was significantly lower. 41) UK GDP was projected to recover further over the remainder of the year, reaching its pre-pandemic level in 2021 Q4, with demand growth boosted by a waning impact from Covid. Further out, the pace of GDP growth was expected to slow towards more normal rates. Over the forecast period, consumption was supported by households running down around 10% of the additional savings they had accumulated in aggregate while spending on some activities had been restricted. Fiscal policy was estimated to continue to support UK demand in the near term, with the policy stance tightening gradually over time in line with government announcements. 42) The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had been 4.8% in the three months to May, 1 percentage point higher than at the end of 2019. The inactivity rate had also been 1 percentage point above its level at the end of 2019. The number of full and part-time furloughed jobs had continued to decline as demand had recovered, but had remained at around 2 million at the end of June. The stock of vacancies had increased further, as had indicators of recruitment difficulties. There appeared to have been difficulties in matching available jobs and workers. These frictions were for a period reducing effective supply in the economy, suggesting that the unemployment rate consistent with stabilising wage growth at rates in line with meeting the inflation target was at present higher than prior to the pandemic. Overall, the MPC judged that spare capacity had been eroded over the past couple of quarters, as demand had outstripped growth in effective supply. Frictions in the labour market were judged likely to dissipate over the forecast period, boosting growth in effective supply capacity. There was uncertainty around these judgements, including how the economy would adjust to the end of the furlough scheme. 43) In the near term, excess demand was projected to emerge in the August Report projections, as the pickup in demand was projected to continue to be a little more rapid than that of supply. Over 2022, however, as supply growth slowed by a little less than demand growth, excess demand was eroded. Demand and supply returned broadly to balance in the third year of the forecast period. 44) There were two-sided risks around the MPC’s assumptions about the degree to which the economy would need to adjust in the medium term in response to the pandemic, and hence its projections for supply growth. One possibility was that the composition of demand would normalise and that any sectoral re-adjustment on the supply side might be relatively quick. Alternatively, a larger reallocation of labour within or across sectors or geographic areas might be required, resulting in more persistent mismatches between supply and demand. 45) Private sector regular pay in the three months to May had been over 7% higher than a year earlier, and annual growth was projected to have peaked at around 8½% in 2021 Q2. Adjusted for the impact of the furlough scheme, the changing composition of employment during the pandemic and annual base effects, underlying pay growth appeared to continue to be around pre-Covid rates. 46) Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 2.5% in June, above the MPC’s 2% target and 0.8 percentage points higher than had been expected in the May Report. Core CPI inflation had also risen further, to 2.3%, as building global input cost pressures had been passed through to some consumer goods prices and, to a lesser degree, the reopening of the economy had led to a pickup in some consumer services and goods prices. 47) CPI inflation was projected to rise temporarily in the near term, to 4% in 2021 Q4, 1.5 percentage points higher than had been expected in the May Report, and owing largely to developments in energy and other goods prices. Above-target inflation was expected to be transitory in the August Report projections, as commodity prices were assumed to stabilise, supply shortages were assumed to ease and global demand to rebalance away from goods and back towards services. As a result, CPI inflation was expected to fall back and was projected to return to close to the 2% target in the medium term. 48) There were two-sided risks around this central path for inflation. On the downside, for example, there could be larger-than-expected supply responses in commodity and other global markets, pushing down on future input prices and import costs. On the upside, current elevated inflationary pressures could potentially lead to some second-round effects on consumer prices. Taking together the evidence from financial market measures and surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters, the Committee judged that UK inflation expectations remained well anchored. The Committee would continue to monitor the risk that domestic and global demand and cost pressures could affect medium-term inflation expectations. 49) The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 50) The Committee’s central expectation was that current elevated global and domestic cost pressures would prove transitory. Nonetheless, the economy was projected to experience a more pronounced period of above-target inflation in the near term than had been expected in the May Report. And, alongside temporary constraints on supply, the rapid recovery in demand had eroded spare capacity such that the economy was projected to have a margin of excess demand for a period. In the medium term, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, inflation was projected to fall back to close to the 2% target, and demand and supply were expected to return broadly to balance. 51) The MPC had, since the second half of 2020, had policy guidance in place specifying that it did not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there was clear evidence that significant progress was being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. The Committee discussed whether the conditions of that guidance had now been met, taking account of both the August Report projections and recent developments in economic data. 52) Some members of the Committee judged that, although considerable progress had been made in achieving the conditions of the MPC’s existing policy guidance, the conditions were not yet met fully. In particular, they judged that it was not sufficiently clear that the economy was on a path to meet the inflation target sustainably, given the remaining downside risks from Covid, and the judgement of these members that GDP and employment were materially below their medium-term potential. 53) The other members of the Committee judged that the conditions of the existing policy guidance had been met fully, as demonstrated by developments in economic data and the latest central projections for spare capacity and CPI inflation in the August Report, but noted that the guidance had made clear that these had only ever been necessary not sufficient conditions for any future tightening in monetary policy. 54) All members confirmed that in judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would, as always, focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that were likely to be transient. In particular, the Committee would not put undue weight on capacity pressures that were frictional in nature and likely to be temporary. The Committee would be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding developments in the labour market, and particularly unemployment, wider measures of slack and underlying wage pressures. In addition, there remained two-sided risks around the central path for inflation in the medium term. Risk management considerations continued to have some force. 55) At this meeting, most members of the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy, which included the previously announced £150 billion increase in the target stock of purchased assets, remained appropriate. 56) For one member, the economic outlook warranted a reduction in the scale of monetary policy stimulus at this MPC meeting. This member preferred to stop the current asset purchase programme as soon as practical after this meeting rather than continue it until around the end of the year, as currently planned. This member judged that, with the existing policy stance, inflation was likely to remain above the 2% target two and three years ahead. This reflected the prospect of a larger and more persistent level of excess demand in the United Kingdom and a greater impact from global cost pressures than in the central forecast in the August Report. Moreover, continuing with asset purchases when CPI inflation was 4% and the output gap was closed, as was likely to be the situation later this year, might cause medium-term inflation expectations to drift higher. A modest tightening of monetary policy at this meeting would mitigate these risks, which otherwise might ultimately necessitate a more abrupt subsequent tightening in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment. 57) The Committee judged that, should the economy evolve broadly in line with the central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report , some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period was likely to be necessary to be consistent with meeting the inflation target sustainably in the medium term. 58) The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 0.1%; The Bank of England should maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £20 billion; The Bank of England should continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these purchases at £875 billion. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the first and second propositions. Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Dave Ramsden, Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe) voted in favour of the third proposition. One member (Michael Saunders) voted against this proposition, preferring to reduce the target for the stock of UK government bond purchases from £875 billion to £830 billion. Operational considerations 59) The existing programme of £150 billion of UK government bond purchases had started in January and its completion was expected by around the end of 2021. Further details of the planned operational approach to gilt purchases between the August and December MPC meetings were set out in the Market Notice accompanying these minutes. Should market functioning worsen materially, the Bank of England stood ready to increase the pace of purchases to ensure the effective transmission of monetary policy. 60) In addition, and as also described in the Market Notice accompanying these minutes, the Committee agreed to reinvest £16.6 billion of cash flows associated with the redemptions of the September 2021 gilt held by the Asset Purchase Facility. 61) The Committee would keep the asset purchase programme under review. If needed, there was scope for the Bank of England to re-evaluate the existing technical parameters of the gilt purchase programme. The MPC’s monetary policy toolkit 62) In its February 2021 minutes, the Committee had requested that the PRA should engage with PRA-regulated firms to ensure they commenced preparations in order to be ready to implement a negative Bank Rate at any point after six months. The MPC had also requested that Bank staff should commence internal technical preparations to deliver the option of a tiered system of reserve remuneration that could be ready to be implemented, should it be judged appropriate, alongside a negative Bank Rate. As the Committee had stressed in February, these preparations should not be interpreted as a signal that the setting of a negative Bank Rate was imminent, or in prospect at some specific time. At its August meeting, the Committee had been briefed that technical preparations internally and by PRA-regulated firms had progressed sufficiently that a negative Bank Rate could be implemented by the system as a whole, with or without tiered reserve account remuneration, if warranted. 63) In Box A of the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report , the Committee had set out its updated strategy for the mix of its monetary policy tools and its intended approach to using the instruments in its toolkit to deliver any tightening in the overall stance of policy, should that be required. The path of Bank Rate and the stock of purchased assets over the next few years would depend on economic developments. The overall stance of monetary policy would, as always, be set to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helped sustain growth and employment. 64) Finally, on behalf of the Committee, the Chair expressed his appreciation to Gertjan Vlieghe for his contributions to the work of the MPC since becoming a member in 2015. 65) The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Jonathan Haskel Dave Ramsden Michael Saunders Silvana Tenreyro Gertjan Vlieghe Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Bradley Fried was also present on 2 August, as an observer, for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 22 September will be published on 23 September 2021.

Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 22 September 2021 ( PDF 0.4MB) PDF Close dialog Published on 23 September 2021 Monetary Policy Summary, September 2021 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 22 September 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £20 billion. The Committee voted by a majority of 7-2 for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at £895 billion. In the MPC’s central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report , UK GDP was projected to recover further over the remainder of the year, with demand growth boosted by a waning impact from Covid-19 (Covid). There was projected to be a period of excess demand in the near term, before demand and supply were expected to return broadly to balance as demand growth slowed and constraints on supply eased. CPI inflation was projected to rise temporarily in the near term, to 4% in 2021 Q4, owing largely to developments in energy and goods prices. Conditioned on the market path for interest rates, CPI inflation was expected to fall back to close to the 2% target in the medium term. Since the August MPC meeting, the pace of recovery of global activity has showed signs of slowing. Against a backdrop of robust goods demand and continuing supply constraints, global inflationary pressures have remained strong and there are some signs that cost pressures may prove more persistent. Some financial market indicators of inflation expectations have risen somewhat, including in the United Kingdom. Bank staff have revised down their expectations for the level of UK GDP in 2021 Q3 by around 1% since the August Report, leaving the expected level of Q3 GDP around 2½% below its pre-Covid level. This downward revision in part reflects the emergence of some supply constraints on output. These have been evident in surveys showing historically lengthy supplier delivery times and backlogs of work, significant material and labour shortages in a number of sectors, and lower than normal levels of inventories. Momentum appears to have picked up in services-orientated sectors where output remains well below pre-Covid levels. Although official estimates of retail sales have weakened somewhat, other indicators of spending have generally remained at strong levels, as has consumer confidence. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate fell to 4.6% in the three months to July, slightly below the August Report forecast, while HMRC payroll data suggest that employee numbers (which include furloughed jobs) surpassed their 2019 Q4 level in August. The number of full and part-time furloughed jobs has continued to decline, but, on the basis of the most recent reported number of 1.7 million in July, to a materially lesser degree than estimated in the August Report. There have been few signs of any increase in redundancies, and the stock of vacancies has increased further, as have indicators of recruitment difficulties. Bank staff’s estimate of underlying pay growth has picked up, to above its pre-pandemic rate. Uncertainty around the outlook for the labour market has therefore increased. Key questions include how the economy will adjust to the closure of the furlough scheme at the end of September; the extent, impact and duration of any change in unemployment; as well as the degree and persistence of any difficulties in matching available jobs with workers. The Committee will review these, along with other, developments as part of its forthcoming forecast round ahead of the November Monetary Policy Report, which will also include its periodic assessment of the supply side of the economy. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 2.0% in July to 3.2% in August, compared with the 3.0% figure expected in the August Report, and triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that is being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Core inflation also rose to 3.1% in August, its highest rate since November 2011. While base effects accounted for the majority of the increase in CPI inflation between July and August, global cost pressures have continued to affect UK consumer goods prices. To a lesser degree, the reopening of the economy has led to a further increase in some consumer services prices. Indicators of households’ medium-term inflation expectations have increased in recent months, with the Citi/YouGov five-to-ten year ahead measure at its highest level since 2013 in September. CPI inflation is expected to rise further in the near term, to slightly above 4% in 2021 Q4, owing largely to developments in energy and goods prices. The material rise in spot and forward wholesale gas prices since the August Report represents an upside risk to the MPC’s inflation projection from April 2022. Most other indicators of cost pressures have remained elevated. The Committee’s central expectation continues to be that current elevated global cost pressures will prove transitory. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy has been subject to very large shocks. Given the lag between changes in monetary policy and their effects on inflation, the Committee, in judging the appropriate policy stance, will as always focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, rather than factors that are likely to be transient. At its previous meeting, the Committee judged that, should the economy evolve broadly in line with the central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report , some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period was likely to be necessary to be consistent with meeting the inflation target sustainably in the medium term. Some developments during the intervening period appear to have strengthened that case, although considerable uncertainties remain. The Committee will be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding developments in the labour market, and particularly unemployment, wider measures of slack and underlying pay pressures; the extent to which businesses pass on wage and other cost increases, as well as medium-term inflation expectations. At this meeting, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 22 September 2021 1) Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2) The global economy had continued to recover and UK-weighted global GDP growth in 2021 Q2 had been broadly in line with expectations at the time of the August Monetary Policy Report . Global activity was now expected to grow at a slightly slower pace in Q3, however, accounted for largely by weaker growth in the United States and China. There had also been some early evidence of a rotation in demand from goods to services, with the services PMIs above or in line with the manufacturing PMIs in the United States and the euro area. Against a backdrop of robust goods demand and continuing supply constraints, global inflationary pressures had remained strong and there were some signs that cost pressures might prove more persistent. 3) Euro-area GDP had picked up by 2.2% in 2021 Q2, stronger than had been expected at the time of the August Report. The number of Covid cases appeared to have stabilised in most euro-area countries alongside a recovery in mobility and continued progress in vaccination programmes. Turning to Q3, the euro-area manufacturing PMI had remained well above its historical average, although it had fallen back to its weakest level in six months in August, with supply constraints affecting activity. The services PMI had also remained elevated. Bank staff now expected euro-area GDP growth in Q3 to be somewhat stronger than at the time of the August Report, but the level of GDP was expected to remain below its pre-Covid level. 4) US GDP had risen by 1.6% in 2021 Q2, slightly weaker than had been expected at the time of the August Report. In the labour market, non-farm payrolls had increased by 235,000 in August, a much slower pace than the average of around 1 million jobs that had been added over the previous two months. The unemployment rate had nevertheless fallen to 5.2%. Although Covid cases had now started to fall across most US regions, they had remained elevated and the pace of the vaccination rollout had slowed considerably in recent months, as some southern states in particular had seen a lower take-up. But mobility and activity had held up in these states despite this, consistent with the link between cases and activity having weakened. Real personal consumption spending had fallen by 0.1% in July, with services spending continuing to recover relative to goods spending. The most recent high-frequency spending data had also pointed to some slowdown in consumer spending, although they had remained above their pre-Covid levels. Overall, US GDP in Q3 was expected to rise by somewhat less than at the time of the August Report. 5) Chinese activity had slowed in July, with the re-imposition of localised lockdowns in response to outbreaks of Covid weighing on mobility. Official data and business surveys had pointed to a further moderation in activity in August, and GDP in 2021 Q3 was expected to rise by slightly less than at the time of the August Report. 6) The recovery in other large Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) had been weaker than expected at the time of the August Report, accounted for particularly by the impact on GDP of the delta variant-driven second wave in India. Covid cases in these EMEs had generally fallen in recent months and there had been an increase in the pace of vaccination rollouts in some of these economies, although vaccination rates had still remained below the levels seen in most advanced economies. Indicators of economic mobility had generally held up across EMEs recently, even when Covid cases had risen. 7) Global inflationary pressures had remained strong. Manufacturing input and output prices had continued to rise sharply, albeit at marginally slower rates. Oil prices had remained elevated compared to their pre-Covid levels, with the Brent oil spot price around $74 per barrel. Wholesale gas prices had risen sharply in Europe and Asia, driven by a combination of strong global demand and a range of supply constraints, including a low level of inventories after an unusually long and cold winter in Europe, as well as a lower-than-usual availability of wind energy in recent weeks. Non-energy commodity prices, in aggregate, had been largely unchanged. Shipping costs had continued to rise, with spot rates rising particularly sharply on certain routes. The strength in shipping costs had continued to reflect a range of factors, including strong global goods demand, as well as supply chain disruptions such as congestion and Covid-related closures at some large ports. Supplier delivery times had continued to rise. Supply conditions had appeared to have improved slightly in some sectors such as semiconductor production, although it would take some time for previous order backlogs to clear. Global containerised trade flows had continued to recover and world trade volumes had been 6.5% above pre-pandemic levels in 2021 Q2. 8) In the euro area, twelve-month headline HICP inflation had risen to 3.0% in August, from 2.2% in July, stronger than had been expected at the time of the August Report. Core inflation had also risen to 1.6% from 0.7%, accounted for in part by a substantial increase in clothing and footwear inflation. 9) US CPI inflation had remained elevated in August, although it had eased slightly to 5.3% in August from a 13-year high of 5.4% in June and July. Headline PCE inflation had picked up a little further to 4.2% in July, and core PCE inflation had remained unchanged at 3.6%. The rise in headline inflation had primarily been driven by sectors that were sensitive to the reopening of the US economy. But there had been some signs that price pressures in other sectors were easing. For example, the contribution to inflation of used cars prices and other durable goods prices had eased in the past couple of months. Monetary and financial conditions 10) Since the Committee’s previous meeting, advanced-economy financial market prices had generally moved within a narrow range. Equity prices and corporate bond spreads had changed little, while shorter-term and longer-term government bond yields had increased slightly. Most recently, global equity prices had been more volatile, in part driven by the financial distress at Evergrande Group, one of China’s largest property developers. 11) Market implied measures of advanced-economy policy rates had increased slightly since the Committee’s previous meeting. In the United Kingdom, increases in the level of Bank Rate to 25 basis points and 50 basis points were now expected in May 2022 and December 2022 respectively, compared to August 2022 and February 2024 at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting. Market expectations of the first 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate in the United States had been brought forward to February 2023 from June 2023. At its meeting on 9 September, the ECB Governing Council had decided to reduce moderately the pace of asset purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. The Governing Council had left its key policy rates unchanged. 12) Some financial market indicators of inflation expectations had risen somewhat, including in the United Kingdom. Near-term measures of inflation compensation, such as the one-year inflation swap rate, one year forward, had risen substantially in the United Kingdom since the Committee’s previous meeting. The driver of this movement appeared to be the stronger than expected CPI inflation outturn. Five-year inflation swap rates, five years forward, an indicator of medium-term inflation expectations, had increased slightly and were around 20 basis points above their 2019 average. 13) Real yields implied by advanced-economy longer-term government bonds had fallen substantially since their recent peak in March 2021, and were now significantly lower than their pre-pandemic levels. Alongside this, advanced-economy equity prices had increased materially since the beginning of this year, such that, in some large advanced economies, they had increased significantly above their pre-pandemic levels. 14) Market contacts had put forward several possible explanations for this constellation of asset prices. Some had attributed low real yields primarily to expectations of monetary policy, which could remain highly accommodative if central banks looked through any transitory increases in inflation, while also supporting risky asset prices. These contacts had expected real rates to rise over time, with a range of views around how gradually this might occur. Other contacts had attributed low real yields to a more pessimistic outlook for medium-term global growth than had appeared to be incorporated into equity valuations. 15) The sterling effective exchange rate had been broadly stable since the previous MPC meeting. 16) Mortgage credit conditions in the United Kingdom had eased further, with a further fall in lending spreads on most mortgage products. Spreads on products with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios lower than or equal to 75% were now similar to spreads in January 2020, while spreads on products with LTV ratios higher than 75% had remained above their January 2020 levels. The number of mortgage products available had continued to improve, with availability for products with low LTV ratios now similar to pre-pandemic levels, although availability for products with high LTV ratios had remained below pre-pandemic levels. Supervisory intelligence suggested that lenders had become more optimistic about the economic outlook, while bank wholesale funding spreads had fallen over recent months and ring-fenced banks had ample liquidity from strong deposit growth. 17) Credit conditions for unsecured borrowing by households and for lending to small and medium-sized enterprises had changed little since the Committee’s previous meeting and spreads had remained below the MPC’s forecasts made earlier this year. Demand and output 18) Since the MPC’s previous meeting, the number of hospitalisations of Covid-19 (Covid) patients and deaths within 28 days of testing positive for Covid had tended to rise in the United Kingdom, although the number of Covid cases had started to fall back again most recently. The number of people that had been asked to self-isolate temporarily through various channels had declined sharply following a change in guidance in August that meant that those people who had had two doses of a Covid vaccine no longer had to isolate if they came into contact with someone who had tested positive for the virus. The UK Government had recently announced its autumn and winter plan for responding to Covid, including that all children aged 12 to 15 would be offered one dose of a Covid vaccine, and that all adults over 50 and those that were clinically vulnerable would be offered a booster jab. Covid-related restrictions on international travel had also been relaxed recently. 19) According to the ONS’s first quarterly estimate, UK GDP had risen by 4.8% in 2021 Q2, close to the projection incorporated into the August Monetary Policy Report for the quarter as a whole. That had left the level of GDP around 4½% below its pre-Covid level in 2019 Q4. Within the expenditure components, household consumption had been estimated to have risen by 7.3% following the reopening of the retail and hospitality sectors through the second quarter, although that had been a somewhat weaker increase than expected in the August Report. Business investment, which was often subject to revision, had also risen by less than had been expected, by 2.4% and had remained around 15% below its pre-Covid level. Government consumption had increased by over 6%, as education output had rebounded due to the recovery in pupil attendance after earlier restrictions had been lifted. 20) Ahead of the MPC’s next meeting, the ONS would release Blue Book-consistent revisions to GDP as part of the Quarterly National Accounts published on 30 September, including significant methodological changes such as the introduction of double deflation and improvements to deflators for items such as telecommunications and clothing. Some of these changes were expected to raise pre-pandemic economic growth rates. 21) Official output data for June and July had been somewhat weaker than expected in the August Report, with monthly growth rates of 1.0% and 0.1% respectively, implying that the level of GDP had been around 3½% below its 2019 Q4 level in the middle of the year. The downside news appeared to have reflected signs that bottlenecks in supply chains and labour shortages had started to affect output, particularly in the manufacturing and construction sectors, combined with a slower-than-expected recovery in demand in some consumer-facing services. 22) A further recovery in activity appeared to be underway in components of output that had remained well below their pre-Covid levels to date, such as some consumer-facing services, and transport and workplace-related services. For example, faster indicators of the use of public transport and the number of flights had risen over recent weeks. And there was some evidence to suggest spending on entertainment and recreational events had increased, as restrictions had loosened further. Education output was also likely to have risen towards its normal level. Taken together, these components were judged likely to account for a large part of the GDP growth expected in 2021 Q3. 23) Other indicators of household spending had generally remained at strong levels, as had consumer confidence. Although official estimates of retail sales volumes had fallen by 0.9% in August, the level of sales had remained over 4% above its pre-Covid level. Food store sales had fallen, while faster indicators of restaurant spending had picked up. Housing activity indicators had remained robust, including mortgage approvals for house purchase. Although the July UK House Price Index had unwound almost all of its record rise in June, perhaps related to the timing of the tapering of the temporary stamp duty cut in England and Northern Ireland, other timelier house price data had picked up further. 24) It appeared likely that the impact of supply constraints on output would prove more persistent. Supplier delivery times had continued to lengthen materially in the manufacturing and construction sectors according to the latest PMI surveys. And over half of the respondents to the latest CBI Industrial Trends survey had reported that materials or components were a factor limiting production over the next three months, with about a third of respondents noting that skilled labour was also a limiting factor, both of which were close to historical series’ highs. Supply chain issues had led respondents to the latest CBI’s Distributive Trades survey to report the lowest level of retail inventories, relative to expected sales, on record. Backlogs of work had also risen according to that component of the services PMI, linked primarily to shortages of key staff. Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that, against a backdrop of strong demand, it might take some quarters for supply issues to be resolved in some cases. Separately, recent high spot wholesale gas prices had significantly affected the production plans of some sectors. 25) Overall, Bank staff had revised down their expectations for 2021 Q3 GDP growth from 2.9% at the time of the August Report to 2.1%, in part reflecting the emergence of some supply constraints on output. That would leave the level of Q3 GDP around 2½% below its pre-Covid level. 26) Alongside the launch of Spending Review 2021 on 7 September, the Government had announced a new, Health and Social Care Levy from April 2022, the proceeds of which would be used for spending on health and social care. This would be based on an increase in National Insurance Contributions for all working adults and a rise in dividend tax rates. The overall envelope for core day-to-day departmental spending was otherwise assumed to follow the path set out at spring Budget 2021. The Government had also announced that the state pension triple lock would be suspended for fiscal year 2022-23. The Spending Review would conclude on 27 October alongside both an autumn Budget, and an updated economic and fiscal forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Supply, costs and prices 27) The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen to 4.6% in the three months to July, slightly below the expectations in the August Monetary Policy Report . The unemployment rate had remained 0.8 percentage points above its 2019 Q4 level of 3.8%. LFS employment had grown by 0.6% in the three months to July, slightly above expectations at the time of the August Report. HMRC payroll data suggested that employee numbers had increased by 241,000 in August and had surpassed their 2019 Q4 level, although these data were prone to revision. The inactivity rate had fallen to 36.7% in the three months to July and had unwound around one fifth of its increase over the course of the pandemic. 28) HMRC administrative data suggested that around 1.7 million jobs, just under 7% of private sector jobs, had been furloughed on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) in July, compared to around 2 million jobs furloughed in June. This was a materially higher number of jobs furloughed than had been assumed at the time of the August Report, in part possibly reflecting the downside news in GDP growth over that period. Additionally, the reweighting of the ONS’s Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) had led to a substantial upward revision to the estimated share of private sector jobs furloughed, relative to the data that had been available at the time of the August Report. Recent BICS data suggested that the number of jobs furloughed had declined to around 6% of private sector jobs over the two weeks to 5 September. Staff estimates suggested that just under half of those jobs furloughed had been on a flexible form of furlough that allowed those employees to have undertaken some work with their employer. The proportion of salary for furloughed hours covered by the Government had been tapered progressively, from 80% to 70% in July and to 60% from 1 August, with employers required to top up to 80% since July. The CJRS would end on 30 September 2021. 29) Indicators of redundancies had remained subdued in the run-up to the end of the CJRS. The level of LFS redundancies had fallen in the three months to July, and the redundancy rate had decreased to 3.4%, around ½ percentage point below pre-pandemic levels. HR1 notifications, a statutory requirement that recorded the advance notification of planned redundancies of 20 or more staff at a single establishment, had remained low, even as the relevant statutory consultation periods overlapped with the end date of the CJRS. Smaller businesses had been disproportionate users of the furlough scheme, however, and by definition were not required to make HR1 notifications. The BICS data had not pointed to an increase in planned redundancies by small businesses over the next three months, although intelligence from the Bank’s Agents had highlighted a risk of some micro businesses, which employed only one or two staff, closing permanently upon the CJRS’s closure. 30) Indicators of labour demand had remained strong and the labour market appeared to have tightened further. The stock of job vacancies had risen above 1 million in August, surpassing the previous record set in July. The ratio of vacancies to unemployment had also risen rapidly, and had surpassed its 2019 average on a single month basis. The REC index of staff availability had tightened at a record pace in August. Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that recruitment difficulties had become more widespread and acute in recent months. Agents’ contacts had attributed labour shortages to a combination of factors, including demand recovering more quickly than expected and a reduction in the availability of EU workers. The shortage of Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers had been exacerbated by an ageing workforce and a backlog of licence testing. 31) Private-sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had risen by 7.8% in the three months to July on a year earlier, compared to 8.4% in the three months to June. AWE growth had continued to be boosted by compositional effects, given that job losses had been skewed towards lower-paid employees during the pandemic. AWE growth had also been pushed up mechanically by the CJRS recently, with just under 7% of private sector jobs having been furloughed in July, compared to around 23% in July 2020. The CJRS had been a drag on measured pay growth over the pandemic period prior to May. Adjusted for the mechanical effects of the CJRS and changes in composition, Bank staff estimated that private sector regular pay growth had been around 4%, above pre-pandemic rates. The REC Report on Jobs permanent staff salaries index, which measured the monthly pay growth of new permanent hires, had increased to its highest level on record and had pointed to robust pay growth of new hires. The Bank’s Agents’ contacts had reported an increase in pay settlements recently. Their contacts had also reported that pay increases had been significantly higher for workers with skills in particularly short supply, such as HGV drivers, while the use of one-off bonuses to retain staff had become more widespread. 32) Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 2.0% in July to 3.2% in August. As the inflation rate in August had been above 3%, an exchange of letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer was being published alongside these minutes. Core inflation had also risen from 1.8% in July to 3.1% in August, its highest rate since November 2011. The headline CPI outturn for August had been 0.2 percentage points above the projection in the August Report. That upside news had been accounted for largely by recreational and audio-visual goods, food and accommodation services. 33) Base effects had accounted for the majority of the increase in twelve-month inflation between July and August. The base effects from last year’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which had dragged on prices in August last year, and the temporarily reduced VAT rate for hospitality, holiday accommodation and attractions dropping out of the annual calculation, had largely accounted for a rise in services inflation to a four-year high. Additionally, other items, such as clothing and footwear and airfares had grown at below average rates in August last year. 34) Global supply bottlenecks had continued to affect UK consumer goods prices. Some consumer goods markets had also been affected indirectly by supply bottlenecks. For example, continuing semiconductor shortages had disrupted new car production, which had led to an increase in demand in the used car market. Twelve-month used car price inflation had risen to 18.3% in August. 35) The reopening of the economy had led to a pickup in some consumer services prices. Recent monthly price increases had been particularly pronounced, relative to historical averages, for those services most directly affected by previous restrictions, such as restaurants recreational and accommodation services. 36) The Committee discussed the near-term outlook for consumer prices. CPI inflation was expected to rise further temporarily, to slightly above 4% in 2021 Q4, slightly higher than the projection in the August Report. 37) Around half of the near-term projected above-target inflation was expected to be accounted for by elevated energy price inflation. The projected contribution of energy prices from October 2021 reflected a base effect as well as Ofgem’s most recent announced increases in the standard variable tariff caps on retail gas and electricity prices. Spot and forward wholesale gas prices had risen materially since the publication of the August Report, against a backdrop of strong demand and some supply disruption. This could represent a significant upside risk to the MPC’s inflation projection from April 2022, when Ofgem next updated its retail energy price caps based on the relevant forward contracts, and meant that CPI inflation would remain slightly above 4% into 2022 Q2, all else equal. 38) Core goods inflation was expected to remain above pre-pandemic averages, accounting for most of the remainder of the projected above-target inflation. In contrast to much of the pandemic period, services inflation was expected to rise slightly, to rates close to pre-Covid averages, which in part reflected a continued recovery of activity in consumer-facing services, as well as the tapered rise in VAT on hospitality, holiday accommodation and attractions from October. Most indicators of cost pressures had remained elevated. Manufacturers’ output prices, excluding food and energy, had grown at an annualised rate of close to 10% in the three months to August. Survey-based measures of output and input price inflation, such as the PMIs, had remained at around their recent historically high levels. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported that there had been more signs of cost pass-through in the manufacturing and construction sectors recently. These contacts had also reported some signs of firms passing on some labour cost increases in labour-intensive sectors. 39) Indicators of households’ medium-term inflation expectations had increased in recent months, with the Citi/YouGov five-to-ten year ahead measure at its highest level since 2013 in September. The Bank/Kantar five-year ahead measure of households’ inflation expectations had also increased slightly, but was now around its historical average. There was the potential for short-term measures of households’ expectations to rise further in the coming months, as they had tended to move with official inflation outturns previously. Such movements in these short-term measures would not be inconsistent with household inflation expectations remaining anchored. The August Decision Maker Panel had reported an increase in companies’ one-year ahead own-price inflation expectations. Professional forecasters, on average, expected less of a rise in inflation in the short term than the August Report projection, according to the latest HM Treasury survey of independent forecasters. The immediate policy decision 40) The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 41) In the MPC’s central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report , UK GDP had been projected to recover further over the remainder of the year, with demand growth boosted by a waning impact from Covid-19 (Covid). There had been projected to be a period of excess demand in the near term, before demand and supply had been expected to return broadly to balance as demand growth slowed and constraints on supply eased. CPI inflation had been projected to rise temporarily in the near term, to 4% in 2021 Q4, owing largely to developments in energy and goods prices. Conditioned on the market path for interest rates, CPI inflation had been expected to fall back to close to the 2% target in the medium term. 42) The Committee reviewed recent developments, including the extent to which they had been in line with the projections in the August Report. 43) Since the August MPC meeting, the pace of recovery of global activity had showed signs of slowing. Euro-area GDP growth in 2021 Q2 had been higher than expected at the time of the August Report, and was now expected to be somewhat stronger in Q3 as well. Developments in US GDP had shown the opposite pattern, although the link between Covid cases and activity there had continued to weaken. Growth in China and other large Emerging Market Economies had also weakened somewhat. There had been some early evidence of a rotation in demand from goods to services, with the services PMIs above or in line with the manufacturing PMIs in the United States and the euro area recently. 44) Against a backdrop of robust goods demand and continuing supply constraints, global inflationary pressures had remained strong and there were some signs that cost pressures might prove more persistent. Oil prices had remained elevated and global shipping costs had continued to rise. Wholesale gas prices had risen substantially across Europe. Supply conditions appeared to have improved slightly in the global semiconductors sector, although it would take some time for previous order backlogs to clear. Headline and core consumer price inflation had risen in the euro area and had remained elevated in the United States. 45) Since the Committee’s previous meeting, global equity prices and corporate bond spreads had generally changed little, while shorter-term and longer-term government bond yields had increased slightly, including in the United Kingdom. Mortgage credit conditions in the United Kingdom had eased further, with a further fall in lending spreads on most mortgage products. 46) As of 22 September 2021, the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility had reached £852 billion, including £108 billion of the £150 billion programme of UK government bond purchases announced on 5 November 2020. 47) Bank staff had revised down their expectations for the level of UK GDP in 2021 Q3 by around 1% since the August Report, leaving the expected level of Q3 GDP around 2½% below its pre-Covid level. This downward revision in part reflected the emergence of some supply constraints on output. These had been evident in surveys showing historically lengthy supplier delivery times and backlogs of work, significant material and labour shortages in a number of sectors, and lower than normal levels of inventories. Momentum appeared to have picked up in services-orientated sectors, where output had remained well below pre-Covid levels. Although official estimates of retail sales had weakened somewhat, other indicators of spending had generally remained at strong levels, as had consumer confidence. 48) Bank staff’s initial assessment was that recent fiscal announcements were likely to be broadly neutral for the growth outlook, as higher spending on health and social care would be funded by an increase in National Insurance Contributions and a rise in dividend tax rates. The overall envelope for core day-to-day departmental spending was otherwise assumed to follow the path set out at spring Budget 2021. Ahead of the Committee’s next meeting, the Government would conclude its Spending Review on 27 October alongside both an autumn Budget, and an updated economic and fiscal forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. 49) The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had fallen to 4.6% in the three months to July, slightly below the August Report forecast, while HMRC payroll data suggested that employee numbers (which included furloughed jobs) had surpassed their 2019 Q4 level in August. The inactivity rate had fallen in the three months to July and had unwound around one fifth of its increase over the course of the pandemic. 50) The number of full and part-time furloughed jobs had continued to decline, but to a materially lesser degree than had been estimated in the August Report. That surprise could only partly be explained by downside news in GDP growth. HMRC administrative data suggested that around 1.7 million jobs, just under 7% of private sector jobs, had been furloughed on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) in July, with just under half of those jobs on a flexible form of furlough that allowed those employees to have undertaken some work with their employer. Recent Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) data suggested that the number of jobs furloughed had declined to around 6% of private sector jobs over the two weeks to 5 September. The end of the CJRS on 30 September would remove this support to incomes. 51) There had been few signs of any increase in redundancies, and the stock of vacancies had increased further, as had indicators of recruitment difficulties. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had attributed labour shortages to a combination of factors, including demand recovering more quickly than expected and a reduction in the availability of EU workers. The shortage of Heavy Goods Vehicle drivers had been exacerbated by an ageing workforce and a backlog of licence testing. 52) Bank staff’s estimate of underlying pay growth had picked up, to above its pre-pandemic rate. The Bank’s Agents’ contacts had reported that pay increases had been significantly higher for workers with skills in particularly short supply, while the use of one-off bonuses to retain staff had become more widespread. 53) The Committee discussed explanations for the surprisingly high number of jobs that were still recorded as being furloughed, despite other signals of a rapidly tightening labour market. One possibility was that some companies had continued to use the CJRS to hoard labour ahead of an expected recovery in demand, even though the cost of that strategy had increased recently. Although some of these companies might choose to let staff go at the end of the scheme, others might be sufficiently confident of future demand to retain them. A substantial proportion of furloughed jobs had been at very small companies, including those with a single employee, for which the decision to reopen or not might depend more on idiosyncratic conditions. To the extent that some businesses had not yet brought staff back fully to their pre-Covid workplaces, this might have prolonged furlough in other businesses that supported these workplaces through ancillary goods and services. It was also possible that a greater number of furloughed workers had been able to find second jobs with alternative employers, or had expanded the scope of existing second jobs, which were allowable under the CJRS. These workers would probably not become unemployed at the end of the scheme, although, if they accounted for a large proportion of those still furloughed, it would make current high vacancy rates more difficult to explain. 54) Another hypothesis was that, due to shifts in the pattern of demand during the pandemic, those on furlough were not suitable matches for the job vacancies currently available. Although vacancies had risen across the economy, including in sectors with a high number of furloughed jobs, there could be mismatch at a more granular level across companies within the same sector. In that case, any increase in unemployment following the end of the CJRS might, at least in part, be more structural than cyclical. 55) Overall, the Committee judged that uncertainty around the outlook for the labour market had increased. Key questions included how the economy would adjust to the closure of the furlough scheme at the end of September; the extent, impact and duration of any change in unemployment; as well as the degree and persistence of any difficulties in matching available jobs with workers. 56) The Committee would review these, along with other, developments as part of its forthcoming forecast round ahead of the November Monetary Policy Report, which would also include its periodic assessment of the supply side of the economy. Ahead of the next MPC meeting, official data on furlough numbers would only be available for August, although additional, timelier information would be available from the BICS, other surveys and the Bank’s Agents, including on any potential increase in redundancies. Official labour market data for October, covering the period following the closure of the CJRS, would not be published until after the November MPC meeting. 57) Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 2.0% in July to 3.2% in August, compared with the 3.0% figure expected in the August Report, and had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Core inflation had also risen to 3.1% in August, its highest rate since November 2011. While base effects had accounted for the majority of the increase in CPI inflation between July and August, global cost pressures had continued to affect UK consumer goods prices. To a lesser degree, the reopening of the economy had led to a further increase in some consumer services prices. 58) CPI inflation was expected to rise further in the near term, to slightly above 4% in 2021 Q4, owing largely to developments in energy and goods prices. The material rise in spot and forward wholesale gas prices since the August Report represented an upside risk to the MPC’s inflation projection from April 2022, and meant that CPI inflation could remain above 4% into 2022 Q2, all else equal. Most other indicators of cost pressures had remained elevated. The Committee’s central expectation continued to be that current elevated global cost pressures would prove transitory. Indeed, there were still good reasons to expect material supply responses in commodity and other global markets, pushing down on future input prices and import costs. That said, should the pandemic reinforce the retrenchment of globalisation, there would be less scope for these factors to create future disinflationary pressures. And current elevated inflationary pressures could potentially lead to some second-round effects on consumer prices. 59) Some financial market indicators of inflation expectations had risen somewhat, including in the United Kingdom. The UK five-year inflation swap rate, five years forward was around 20 basis points above its 2019 average. Indicators of UK households’ medium-term inflation expectations had increased in recent months, with the Citi/YouGov five-to-ten year ahead measure at its highest level since 2013 in September. The Bank/Kantar five-year ahead measure of households’ inflation expectations had also increased slightly, but was now around its historical average. Taking together the full range of evidence from financial market measures and surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters, the Committee judged that UK inflation expectations remained well anchored. But given recent developments, the Committee would monitor very closely the risk that domestic and global demand and cost pressures could further affect medium-term inflation expectations. 60) The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 61) The MPC had, since the second half of 2020, had policy guidance in place specifying that it did not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there was clear evidence that significant progress was being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. There remained a range of views on the Committee about whether the conditions of that guidance were met, but all members agreed that the previous formal guidance was no longer useful in the present situation. 62) The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy had been subject to very large shocks. Given the lag between changes in monetary policy and their effects on inflation, the Committee, in judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy, would as always focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, rather than factors that were likely to be transient. 63) At this meeting, most members of the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy, which included the previously announced £150 billion increase in the target stock of purchased assets, remained appropriate. There was a range of views about the most likely near-term path of unemployment following the closure of the furlough scheme. However, all members in this group agreed that the outlook for the labour market, and hence underlying inflationary pressures, was particularly uncertain, and that some of this uncertainty should be resolved over coming months. Hence, there was a high option value in waiting for that additional information before deciding if and when a tightening in monetary policy might be warranted. If there were signs that the unemployment rate was increasing significantly following the end of the CJRS, it might take somewhat longer to assess the extent to which that rise was structural or cyclical, and, if structural and pushing down on effective supply in the economy, for how long that might persist. 64) For members in this group, it remained likely that inflation would fall back in the medium term in line with the projection in the August Report, as supply bottlenecks were cleared, demand growth eased, and companies’ pricing power moderated. On one view, abstracting from current constraints on effective supply, GDP remained well below its medium-term potential level and monetary policy could have a role in sustaining demand, with a view to reducing the degree of medium-term scarring. On another view, the economy had shown further signs of normalising recently and demand could remain strong even while supply constraints proved more long-lasting. CPI inflation had continued to surprise on the upside, some indicators of cost pressures appeared somewhat more persistent and financial market inflation break-evens had continued to rise gradually. Different members placed different weights on these arguments. For all members in this group, monetary policy would at some point need to start to unwind some of its post-pandemic stimulus. 65) All members in this group agreed that any future initial tightening of monetary policy should be implemented by an increase in Bank Rate, even if that tightening became appropriate before the end of the existing UK government bond asset purchase programme. 66) For two members, the economic outlook warranted a tightening in the monetary policy stance at this MPC meeting. There was increasing evidence from a range of global and domestic cost and price indicators that inflationary pressures were likely to persist. Record vacancy levels and the pace of underlying wage growth were evidence of ongoing tightness in labour market conditions, alongside other signs of capacity pressures. These members judged that, with the existing policy stance, inflation was likely to remain above the 2% target in the medium term. This reflected a greater impact from cost pressures, and the prospect of a larger and more persistent level of excess demand in the United Kingdom than in the central forecast in the August Report. 67) These two members preferred to stop the current asset purchase programme as soon as practical after this meeting rather than continuing it until around the end of the year, as currently planned. Continuing with asset purchases when CPI inflation was above 3% and the output gap was closed might cause medium-term inflation expectations to drift up further. A decision to curtail the asset purchase programme at this meeting would imply a modest policy tightening and mitigate that risk, which might otherwise ultimately necessitate a more abrupt subsequent tightening in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment. It would demonstrate the Committee’s commitment to returning inflation to target in the medium term and ensuring that medium-term inflation expectations remained well anchored. 68) At its previous meeting, the Committee had judged that, should the economy evolve broadly in line with the central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report , some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period was likely to be necessary to be consistent with meeting the inflation target sustainably in the medium term. Some developments during the intervening period appeared to have strengthened that case, although considerable uncertainties remained. The Committee would be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding developments in the labour market, and particularly unemployment, wider measures of slack and underlying pay pressures; the extent to which businesses passed on wage and other cost increases, as well as medium-term inflation expectations. 69) The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 0.1%; The Bank of England should maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £20 billion; The Bank of England should continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these purchases at £875 billion. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the first and second propositions. Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the third proposition. Two members (Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders) voted against this proposition, preferring to reduce the target for the stock of UK government bond purchases from £875 billion to £840 billion. Operational considerations 70) The existing programme of £150 billion of UK government bond purchases had started in January and its completion was expected by around the end of 2021. Further details of the planned operational approach to gilt purchases between the August and December MPC meetings had been set out in the Market Notice accompanying the August 2021 minutes. Should market functioning worsen materially, the Bank of England stood ready to increase the pace of purchases to ensure the effective transmission of monetary policy. 71) The Committee would keep the asset purchase programme under review. If needed, there was scope for the Bank of England to re-evaluate the existing technical parameters of the gilt purchase programme. 72) Consistent with the Committee’s previous guidance, the MPC agreed to reinvest the cash flows associated with reductions in the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases held by the Asset Purchase Facility back into eligible corporate bonds, commencing in November 2021. As announced in March, this reinvestment programme would be the first to take the climate impact of the issuers of bonds into account. Further details of reinvestment operations would be published in a Market Notice nearer the time, alongside details of how the Bank’s approach to ‘greening’ the portfolio would be implemented this year. 73) The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Michael Saunders Silvana Tenreyro Tom Josephs was present as the Treasury representative. As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Dorothy Thompson was also present on 15 and 17 September, as an observer, for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in her role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 2 November will be published on 4 November 2021.

Monetary Policy Report - November 2021 Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 2 November 2021 ( PDF 0.4MB) PDF Close dialog Published on 04 November 2021 Monetary Policy Summary, November 2021 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 2 November 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. The MPC voted by a majority of 7-2 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £20 billion. The Committee voted by a majority of 6-3 for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at £895 billion. The Committee’s updated central projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying November Monetary Policy Report . The projections are conditioned on asset and energy prices averaged over the 15 days to 27 October. This gives a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rises to around 1% by the end of 2022. Wholesale energy prices are assumed to be based on their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projections and remain flat beyond that. There are material risks around this assumption. Both global and UK GDP increased in 2021 Q3, although at a slower pace than projected in the August Report. Growth is somewhat restrained by disruption in supply chains. Alongside the rapid pace at which global demand for goods has risen, this has led to supply bottlenecks in certain sectors. There have also been some signs of weaker UK consumption demand. While bottlenecks will continue to restrain growth somewhat in the near term, global and UK GDP are nonetheless expected to recover further from the effects of Covid-19 (Covid). UK GDP is projected to get back to its 2019 Q4 level in 2022 Q1. Over the second half of the forecast period, and conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate, UK GDP growth is expected to be relatively subdued. The pace of growth slows as potential supply growth eases back towards pre-Covid rates, and as higher energy prices and the fading of monetary and fiscal policy support temper demand growth. At the Autumn Budget and Spending Review 2021, the Government announced a higher path for government consumption, particularly over the next couple of years. By the end of the forecast period, a margin of spare capacity is expected to emerge. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate fell to 4.5% in the three months to August, while Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs payroll data have continued to rise strongly. Just over a million jobs are likely to have been furloughed immediately before the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme closed at end-September, significantly more than expected in the August Report. Nonetheless, there have continued to be few signs of increases in redundancies and the stock of vacancies has increased further, as have indicators of recruitment difficulties. Taken together, while there is considerable uncertainty, initial indicators suggest that unemployment will rise slightly in 2021 Q4. Bank staff’s estimate of underlying pay growth has remained above pre-pandemic rates, although pay growth is expected to fall back from its current rate in the November Report central projections. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell slightly from 3.2% in August to 3.1% in September. Bank staff expect inflation to rise to just under 4% in October, accounted for predominantly by the impact on utility bills of past strength in wholesale gas prices. CPI inflation is then expected to rise to 4½% in November and remain around that level through the winter, accounted for by further increases in core goods and food price inflation. Wholesale gas prices have risen sharply since August. CPI inflation is now expected to peak at around 5% in April 2022, materially higher than expected in the August Report. The upward pressure on CPI inflation is expected to dissipate over time, as supply disruption eases, global demand rebalances, and energy prices stop rising. As a result, CPI inflation is projected to fall back materially from the second half of next year. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate and the MPC’s current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation is projected to be a little above the 2% target in two years’ time and just below the target at the end of the forecast period. In an alternative scenario that is conditioned on energy prices following forward curves throughout the forecast period and as set out in the November Report, CPI inflation falls back towards the target more rapidly than in the MPC’s central projection, and is materially lower over the second half of the forecast period. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy has been subject to very large shocks. Given the lag between changes in monetary policy and their effects on inflation, the Committee, in judging the appropriate policy stance, will as always focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that are likely to be transient. At its recent meetings, the Committee has judged that some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period was likely to be necessary to meet the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term. The latest developments, set alongside the Committee’s updated projections, reinforce this view. Nevertheless, near-term uncertainties remain, especially around the outlook for the labour market, and the extent to which domestic cost and price pressures persist into the medium term. At this meeting, the Committee concluded that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. The Committee judges that, provided the incoming data, particularly on the labour market, are broadly in line with the central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report , it will be necessary over coming months to increase Bank Rate in order to return CPI inflation sustainably to the 2% target. In observing the market-implied path for Bank Rate, the Committee notes that, in the November Monetary Policy Report central projections, CPI inflation is projected to be below the 2% target at the end of the forecast period, and would probably fall a little further beyond that point, given the margin of spare capacity that is expected to emerge. Looking beyond the coming months, the Committee will, as always, continue to focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The Committee judges that there are two-sided risks around developments in the economy in the medium term, and will reach its assessment on the balance of these risks in light of the relevant data as they emerge. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 2 November 2021 1) Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the backdrop of its latest economic projections, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2) UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have risen by 1.2% in 2021 Q3, a little weaker than had been expected in the August Monetary Policy Report . This weaker growth had been accounted for by slower-than-expected growth in the United States and China, partly offset by strength in the euro area. Global GDP was expected to expand at a slower pace in Q4 than had been anticipated in the August Report, in part reflecting supply chain disruptions, which had continued to weigh on global activity. Bottlenecks, stemming from supply disruptions and the pattern of global demand, as well as rising energy prices, had continued to increase global cost pressures. 3) Supply chain bottlenecks over recent months had reflected both strong demand for consumer goods in advanced economies, in particular in the United States, and further supply disruptions from localised lockdowns at some major Chinese ports and Covid-related closures of factories in other Asian economies. Estimates of supply constraints constructed by Bank staff, derived from a range of PMIs such as delivery times and stocks of finished goods, had remained elevated since the MPC’s previous meeting. There had been some signs that demand had begun to rotate away from goods and back towards services. That had been most apparent in the United States where durables consumption had moderated. 4) According to the preliminary flash estimate, euro-area GDP had grown by 2.2% in 2021 Q3. This was stronger than had been expected in the August Report, and had left the level of GDP 0.5% below that in 2019 Q4. The upside news had reflected, in part, a smaller-than-expected drag on activity from the spread of the Delta variant. Euro-area GDP growth was expected to be just under 1% in Q4. According to the flash estimate, the euro-area composite output PMI had decreased by 1.9 points in October, to 54.3, with both the services and manufacturing indices decreasing. 5) According to the Advance estimate, US GDP had increased by 0.5% in 2021 Q3. This was weaker than expected at the time of the August Report, but had left the level of GDP around 1½% higher than in 2019 Q4. Within this, household spending had risen by 0.4%, with spending on goods falling but services consumption continuing to rise. More recent high-frequency spending data suggested that social spending, such as on restaurants and recreation, had continued to recover. In the labour market, non-farm payrolls had increased by 194,000 in September, a much slower pace than had been expected by financial markets. The unemployment rate had nevertheless fallen to 4.8% in September, from 5.2% in August, and the level of job vacancies had remained high. US GDP growth was expected to be around 1% in Q4. 6) In China, GDP had increased by 0.2% in 2021 Q3, lower than had been expected at the time of the August Report. This downside news had reflected the impact of local Covid outbreaks on consumption and services activity, power shortages and a rapid slowdown in housing activity. Further stresses in the property market more recently were likely to weigh on activity in the near term. 7) Global inflationary pressures had remained strong since the MPC’s previous meeting. Wholesale gas prices had continued to rise in Europe and Asia, reflecting strong demand, although they had fallen back at the end of October. The Brent oil spot price had risen further and was now around $85 per barrel. Non-energy commodity prices had also increased. Shipping costs had remained elevated, particularly for routes connecting Asia with the United States and with Europe. Survey indicators of manufacturing input and output prices had continued to rise in October in a number of advanced economies. Global cost pressures were expected to dissipate over time as supply disruption eased, global demand rebalanced and energy prices stopped rising. 8) Cost pressures had continued to pass through to consumer prices in the euro area and in the United States. Euro-area HICP inflation had increased to 4.1% in October, its highest rate since 2008, and there had also been an increase in core inflation, which had risen to 2.1%. In the United States, core PCE inflation had remained at 3.6% in September, and the headline measure had risen to 4.4%. Monetary and financial conditions 9) There had been some sizable movements in UK and global financial markets since the Committee’s previous meeting. In part that had reflected the impact of supply chain bottlenecks and sharp rises in energy prices on market participants’ outlook for global inflation and growth, and perceptions of possible monetary policy responses. 10) Advanced-economy longer-term government bond yields had risen by around 20 to 30 basis points since the MPC’s September meeting, in large part reflecting an increase in the inflation compensation component of nominal interest rates. Ten-year bond yields had now mostly reversed the declines seen over the summer and, in the United Kingdom, had exceeded the levels seen immediately prior to the pandemic. 11) Since the Committee’s previous meeting, short-term market measures of inflation compensation had risen sharply across advanced economies, including in the United Kingdom. Market contacts had reported that these increases had largely reflected strength in CPI inflation data, developments in energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks. Medium-term measures of advanced-economy inflation compensation had also continued to rise for much of the period since the Committee’s last meeting. In both the United States and the euro area, these measures were now around their average levels over the past decade. In the United Kingdom, medium-term inflation compensation measures had remained above their post-2008 average levels. 12) Interpreting UK medium-term inflation compensation measures was not straightforward. UK inflation markets were used for hedging large pension liabilities, which could cause shifts in inflation compensation over and above those driven by changes in inflation expectations and perceived inflation risks. Inferences from UK measures, which were based on RPI inflation, about market expectations for CPI inflation were further complicated by the uncertain future wedge between consumer price and RPI inflation. The interpretation of some medium-term measures, including the five-year inflation swap rate, five years forward, was also affected by uncertainty around the planned alignment of the RPI with CPIH in 2030. All else equal, this alignment would push down levels of inflation compensation beyond that point, relative to prices in the past. It was therefore useful to consider a range of inflation compensation measures, including those with reference maturities prior to 2030, such as the three-year inflation swap rate, five years forward. Despite these difficulties in interpretation, models that attempted to extract medium-term market expectations for CPI inflation, and intelligence gathered from market contacts, suggested that higher inflation expectations and greater perceived risks to inflation might have in part accounted for the above-average levels of medium-term inflation compensation measures, alongside other factors. The Committee’s overall assessment of medium-term inflation expectations was set out in Box C in the November Monetary Policy Report . 13) At its 22 September meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had left unchanged its target range for the federal funds rate. The pace of asset purchases had also been left unchanged, but the FOMC had noted that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases might soon be warranted. In their updated Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants had revised up their projections for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate, with the median now rising to 1% in 2023. At its 27 October meeting, the Bank of Canada had left its policy rate unchanged and had ceased its asset purchase programme, moving into a reinvestment phase during which purchases would be made solely to replace maturing bonds. At its meeting on 28 October, the ECB Governing Council had left its key policy interest rates unchanged and had made no significant changes to its asset purchase programmes. On 2 November, the Reserve Bank of Australia had maintained the target for its cash rate, had continued its asset purchase programme and had discontinued its target for the yield on the April 2024 bond. Both the Norges Bank and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had increased policy rates by 25 basis points at their most recent meetings. 14) Across advanced economies, the paths for market-implied policy rates had risen since the Committee’s previous meeting. At the three-year horizon, the market-implied policy rate had risen by around 30 to 40 basis points in the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom. Global interest rate markets had been volatile most recently, in part reflecting diminished market liquidity. 15) In the United Kingdom, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate over the year ahead had increased sharply since the MPC’s September meeting, which appeared to reflect market participants’ perceptions of a further rise in inflationary pressures and recent MPC communications about the policy outlook. Most market contacts were expecting the Committee to raise Bank Rate to 0.25% by the end of the year, with expectations for the exact timing finely balanced between the November and December MPC meetings. The November Report was conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate, based on the 15-working day average to 27 October, that rose to around 1% by the end of 2022. In the immediate run-up to the MPC’s November meeting, the market-implied path for Bank Rate had reached around 1.3% by the end of next year. Market contacts had noted that diminished market liquidity meant that it had become more difficult to infer a central path for Bank Rate expectations. 16) The sterling effective exchange rate index had risen by around 1% since the previous MPC meeting. 17) In contrast to movements in advanced-economy government bond markets, there had been relatively little news in corporate financing conditions. Advanced-economy equity prices had risen since the Committee’s previous meeting, in part supported by strong earnings, and corporate bond spreads had remained at historically low levels. In the United Kingdom, bank credit conditions for corporates had remained broadly stable. 18) Lending rates on mortgages with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios higher than 75% had continued to fall since the September meeting, despite the increases in risk-free rates. The associated relatively sharp narrowing in mortgage spreads was in part likely to reflect the typical lagged response of mortgage rates to movements in risk-free rates, and so, all else equal, this effect would be expected to reverse to some extent. Perhaps consistent with that, there had been a rise in lending rates on some mortgage products with LTV ratios at or below 75% recently. The latest Credit Conditions Survey had suggested that unsecured credit conditions for households had continued to loosen somewhat. Demand and output 19) UK quarterly GDP growth in 2021 Q2 had been revised up to 5.5% in the Quarterly National Accounts (QNA). Estimates of GDP had also been revised higher in preceding quarters, such that the cumulative shortfall in activity since 2019 Q4 was estimated to have been 3.3%, contrasting with an initial estimate of 4.4% and the 4.3% that had been implied in the August Monetary Policy Report projection. 20) The QNA had been aligned with Blue Book 2021, which had included significant methodological changes such as the introduction of double deflation and improvements to deflators for items such as telecommunications and clothing. Reflecting these changes, the contributions of manufacturing and telecoms services to GDP growth had been revised up significantly over recent decades, with largely offsetting revisions to contributions from other sectors such as financial services. Overall, GDP growth was now estimated to have been slightly lower on average in the years leading up to the financial crisis, and slightly higher on average in the subsequent years, most notably between 2016 and 2019. 21) UK GDP was estimated to have risen by 0.4% in August, following a 0.1% fall in July, with activity slightly weaker than expected at the time of the August Report despite the upward revisions to preceding quarters. Much of the upside news in earlier months had been in government services output, and the health sector in particular, where activity had subsequently fallen back in July and August. Manufacturing and construction activity had also weakened since the spring, with output in these sectors around 2% below pre-Covid levels in August. Output in business, and transport and work-related, services had continued to recover, albeit at a more modest pace than had been anticipated. Activity in other consumer-facing services had recovered strongly and by slightly more than had been expected, however. Output in some sub-sectors, such as accommodation and food services, had been at or around pre-Covid levels, although activity in other sub-sectors, such as arts and recreation, had continued to lag further behind pre-pandemic levels. 22) Much of the downside news since the August Report had appeared to reflect the impact of supply chain disruption, particularly for businesses in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Supplier delivery times in those particular sectors had continued to lengthen according to the latest PMI surveys, which had also shown stocks of manufactured goods being at historically low levels and backlogs of work at around historical highs. Rates of outstanding business had also continued to rise for services companies, albeit to a lesser degree. 23) The Bank’s Agents had reported that shortages of materials and labour had weighed on output across a wide range of businesses, and that some businesses expected supply issues for certain products to persist until at least late-2022. According to the latest ONS Business Insights and Conditions Survey, the production or supply chains of around 11% of trading businesses had been affected by the recent sharp increases in gas prices. Consistent with supply disruption continuing, almost two thirds of respondents to the latest CBI Industrial Trends survey had reported that a lack of materials or components were expected to be a factor limiting production over the next three months, and 40% of respondents had cited shortages of skilled labour as a potential limiting factor, with both series at their highest levels since the mid-1970s. 24) High-frequency indicators suggested that consumer spending had recovered further since the summer, but at a more modest pace than had been anticipated at the time of the August Report. A pick-up had been most discernible in those components where shortfalls had originally been the largest, including public transport journeys, flights and cinema visits. Retail sales volumes had fallen in September for the fifth month in a row and by around 5% from their peak in April, although sales volumes had remained around 4% above their 2019 Q4 average. The declines had in part reflected a substitution away from spending on goods back towards services, which Bank staff anticipated could persist for a period as spending continued to converge towards its pre-Covid pattern. Goods spending might have also been dampened by product shortages, with some Agents’ contacts reporting lost sales for products such as electrical goods and furniture, and a continued shortage of new cars for sale in particular. The perception of possible disruption to supply had prompted a burst of spending on motor fuels in late September, and subsequent shortages until additional supplies had been delivered, with spending on fuel being lower than usual thereafter. 25) Indicators of confidence among UK households had fallen in recent weeks, and by more than had been seen in other economies. The number of Covid cases had remained relatively high in the United Kingdom, but, unlike other swings in confidence over the recent past, the latest changes had appeared to reflect non-health factors. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey had shown a further decline in the share of adults expressing worries around Covid in the first half of October, although around two fifths of respondents had remained concerned. The softening in consumer confidence might have instead reflected idiosyncratic factors, such as the recent fuel shortages, or recent or prospective changes in individuals’ real incomes. In addition to increases in inflation, largely associated with higher energy costs, some households had been affected by the withdrawal of fiscal measures to support the economy during the Covid crisis, such as the removal of the temporary £20 per week uplift to Universal Credit at the end of September. The September Bank of England/NMG household survey had continued to show that households in aggregate were expecting to increase their spending over the next three months, but that those on relatively low incomes were still expecting to reduce their spending. There had also been declines in the share of households anticipating a return to pre-Covid levels of spending by the end of this year or by the middle of 2022. 26) Businesses’ investment intentions over the year ahead had remained robust, although to a lesser degree in the near term. Business investment had risen by 4.5% in 2021 Q2, but was still around 13% below its 2019 Q4 level. The October Decision Maker Panel had continued to report that the drag from Covid on business investment was lessening over time, but more gradually than had been anticipated in July, with investment in 2021 Q4 expected to be around 7% lower than it would otherwise have been. Some contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported investment having been held back by shortages of equipment and skilled labour. Nevertheless, the Agents’ special survey of investment intentions had indicated a strong rebound in spending over the next twelve months, particularly among consumer services firms. Businesses had generally looked to reinstate investment plans that had been put on hold, or had been considering other new projects that were perceived as being lower risk, as part of a desire to increase efficiency and productivity, and to improve digital capabilities. 27) Overall, GDP was expected to grow by around 1.5% in 2021 Q3 and by 1% in Q4 in the November Report projections, around half of the rates envisaged in the August Report. As a result, GDP was expected to remain below its pre-Covid level until 2022 Q1. While this downward revision had mainly reflected supply chain disruption, a more modest recovery in consumer demand in particular had also been a contributing factor. 28) At the Autumn Budget and Spending Review 2021, the Government had announced significant increases in public services spending alongside other tax and welfare changes. These increases in spending were in addition to the higher health and social care spending announced in September alongside the new Health and Social Care Levy. Bank staff had estimated that the fiscal policies announced since the August Report would boost GDP by just over ½% at their peak in fiscal year 2023-24. Supply, costs and prices 29) The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen to 4.5% in the three months to August, 0.3 percentage points lower than had been expected at the time of the August Monetary Policy Report . The jobless rate had remained above its 2019 Q4 level, however, with that increase almost entirely accounted for by those that had been unemployed for six months or longer. LFS employment had risen by 0.7% in the three months to August, to 1.6% below its 2019 Q4 level, with that shortfall more than accounted for by lower self employment. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) employee payrolls had risen by 210,000 in the single month of September, although these initial estimates had tended to be revised down somewhat. The increase in the total number of payroll employees compared to its pre-pandemic level had been more than accounted for by a sustained increase in workers in the health, education and public administration sector over the past year. In contrast, the number of employees in consumer-facing services had remained some way below pre-Covid levels. 30) The LFS inactivity rate had fallen slightly in the three months to August, accounted for largely by a fall in inactive students and discouraged workers, but was still around 1 percentage point higher than immediately prior to the pandemic. Average hours worked had continued to increase in the three months to August, as those on furlough had increasingly returned to work, and were now only a little below their 2019 Q4 level. 31) According to HMRC administrative data, around 1.4 million jobs, just over 5½% of private sector jobs, had been furloughed on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) in August, compared to around 1.7 million jobs furloughed in July. This had been in line with estimates derived from the ONS’s Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS), but was more than double the assumption incorporated in the August Report. Fully furloughed jobs had accounted for 55% of the total number of jobs furloughed in August. Smaller firms with less than 10 employees had accounted for around half of furloughed jobs. The latest BICS data suggested that the share of private sector jobs furloughed had fallen to 4½%, or around 1.1 million jobs, in the final ten days of the CJRS at the end of September. 32) There was so far little evidence that the end of the CJRS had led to a significant increase in unemployment, although there remained uncertainty around the outlook. Indicators of redundancies had remained subdued, including the latest BICS data on planned redundancies by small businesses over the next three months. The Bank’s Agents had not picked up reports of widespread layoffs, and some larger companies in sectors where demand was still weak had reported that they were likely to continue to retain staff in anticipation of a recovery. 33) Indicators of employment demand and labour market tightness had remained elevated. The stock of job vacancies recorded by the ONS had reached another record high of 1.1 million in the three months to September, and the strength had been relatively broad-based across sectors and by firm size. The ratio of vacancies to unemployment had also reached its highest level since a consistent series had been available in 2001. Higher frequency indicators of the number of online vacancies had risen further in October. The REC staff availability indices had remained at historically very low levels. Companies across a wide range of sectors had reported an increase in hiring intentions to the Bank’s Agents. At the same time, staff turnover had picked up and recruitment difficulties had become more broad based, with companies reporting acute shortages in a range of occupations. The Agents’ score for companies’ staff recruitment difficulties was at its highest level since the series had begun in 1997. 34) Private-sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had risen by 6.8% in the three months to August on a year earlier, broadly in line with expectations at the time of the August Report. Adjusted for the mechanical effects of the CJRS and changes in composition, Bank staff estimated that private sector regular pay growth had risen to around 4½%, above pre-pandemic rates of around 3½%. The REC permanent staff salaries index, which measured the monthly pay growth of new permanent hires, had increased to another record high in September, with respondents to the survey noting greater competition for workers and that some job candidates had been able to successfully negotiate higher starting pay. 35) Median whole-economy employment-weighted annual basic pay growth in the Bank’s pay settlements database had remained at 3% over recent months, slightly higher than in 2020 and compared with growth of 2% in 2019. That was broadly consistent with pay settlements reported to the Bank’s Agents, which had continued to increase as the labour market had tightened. Within the aggregate reports, there had been a rising number of targeted pay awards in excess of 5%, to compensate workers for pay freezes during the pandemic or to retain staff with skills in particularly high demand. Recent trends in settlements were difficult to determine with precision, given the seasonality of pay negotiations and the relatively low numbers of settlements included in early estimates. 36) The Government had announced at the Autumn Budget and Spending Review 2021 that the National Living Wage for those aged over 23 would rise by 6.6% from April 2022, with large rises in the National Minimum Wage for younger workers as well. The temporary pause in public sector pay progression introduced in November 2020 had also been lifted, with pay awards to be determined after independent pay review bodies made their recommendations ahead of next April. 37) Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen slightly, from 3.2% in August to 3.1% in September. Core inflation, excluding food, beverages, tobacco and energy, had also declined, from 3.1% to 2.9%. Both of these outturns had been broadly in line with expectations at the time of the August Report. Within the components, core goods inflation had remained at an eleven-year high of 3.3%. Services inflation had fallen to 2.6%, largely reflecting the unwind of the boost to inflation in August from last year’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme. 38) Bank staff expected CPI inflation to rise to just under 4% in October, accounted for predominantly by the impact on utility price inflation of previously announced increases in Ofgem’s standard variable tariff caps on gas and electricity prices. CPI inflation was expected to rise to 4½% in November and remain around that level through the winter, accounted for by further increases in core goods and food price inflation. 39) Most survey indicators of costs and prices were at historically elevated levels. Food input costs had risen materially, while core manufacturing producer output price inflation had reached its highest level since 2008 in September. Services producer price inflation had increased to 3.6% in 2021 Q3, from 2.0% in Q2, also the highest rate since 2008. Some of that strength had been due to components related to freight and support services, and could partly reflect recent congestion at some ports. The flash composite input and output price PMIs had risen to record highs in October, with contacts attributing those movements to supply shortages, rising fuel, transport and energy bills, and stronger wage pressures. The Bank’s Agents had also reported that increased costs were being passed through to output and retail prices to a greater extent than previously. 40) At the Autumn Budget and Spending Review 2021, the government had announced a number of changes to excise duties, including a major reform of the alcohol duty regime and a freezing of duties for one year from February 2022, and a freezing of fuel duties for one year from April 2022. Taken together, these announcements represented around 0.1 percentage points of downside news to Bank staff’s CPI inflation forecast. 41) Wholesale gas prices had continued to rise sharply since the September MPC meeting, although they had fallen back at the very end of October. The rises in gas and electricity futures prices suggested that Ofgem’s retail price caps would increase materially further from April 2022. Taking account of this, CPI inflation was expected to pick up to close to 5% in 2022 Q2, around 1 percentage point higher than had been expected in the August Report. Ofgem had announced recently that it would consult on its price cap methodology ahead of determining the energy price caps in April. 42) Since the MPC’s previous meeting, the Citi/YouGov measure of household inflation expectations for the year ahead had risen from 4.1% in September to 4.4% in October, its highest level since 2008. The five-to-ten year ahead measure had fallen slightly to 3.7%, after rising sharply in September. In common with other business survey indicators of companies’ own pricing intentions, the Decision Maker Panel series on expected price growth over the next twelve months was at elevated levels, and had risen sharply in October. Responses to questions in the CBI Distributive Trades survey on the expected change in the general level of prices in the markets in which firms compete, over the next year and two years, were broadly in line with past averages, however. Professional forecasters expected CPI inflation to be close to target in the medium term. The immediate policy decision 43) The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 44) The Committee reviewed recent developments against the backdrop of its latest economic projections as set out in the accompanying November Monetary Policy Report . The projections were conditioned on asset and energy prices averaged over the 15 working days to 27 October. This gave a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rose to around 1% by the end of 2022. Wholesale energy prices were assumed to be based on their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projections and remain flat beyond that. There were material risks around this assumption. 45) UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have risen by 1.2% in 2021 Q3, a little weaker than had been expected in the August Report. This had been accounted for by slower-than-expected growth in the United States and China, partly offset by strength in the euro area. Growth was somewhat restrained by disruption in supply chains. Alongside the rapid pace at which global demand for goods had risen, this had led to supply bottlenecks in certain sectors. Fiscal stimulus, particularly in the United States, had continued to boost materially consumers’ demand for durable goods, although to a lesser extent than earlier in the year. Supply disruptions from localised lockdowns at some major Chinese ports and Covid-related closures of factories in other Asian economies had weighed on activity. 46) Global GDP in 2021 Q4 was also expected to expand at a slower pace than had been anticipated in the August Report. Supply and demand imbalances were expected to ease over 2022 in the November Report projections, reflecting a continued rotation of demand back towards services in advanced economies, and a dissipation of supply disruptions. 47) Supply chain bottlenecks and rising energy prices had continued to increase global cost pressures. Wholesale gas prices had risen further in Europe and Asia, as had the Brent oil price, and shipping costs had remained elevated. In the November Report projections, world export prices excluding fuels were projected to rise by around 6% in 2021 as a whole. Export price inflation was then expected to fall back, as bottlenecks eased relatively gradually, energy prices stopped rising and shipping costs decreased. 48) There had been some sizable movements in UK and global financial markets since the Committee’s previous meeting. Advanced-economy longer-term government bond yields had increased, in large part reflecting an increase in the inflation compensation component of nominal interest rates. Advanced-economy equity prices had risen, while corporate bond spreads had remained at historically low levels. 49) Market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate over the year ahead had increased sharply since the MPC’s September meeting, although a deterioration in liquidity conditions meant that it had become more difficult to infer a central path for policy expectations. Most market contacts were expecting the Committee to increase Bank Rate to 0.25% by the end of this year, with expectations for the exact timing finely balanced between the November and December meetings. 50) As of 2 November 2021, the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility had reached £871 billion, including £127 billion of the £150 billion programme of UK government bond purchases announced on 5 November 2020. 51) In 2021 Q2, the cumulative shortfall in UK GDP since 2019 Q4 was estimated to have been 3.3%, compared with the 4.3% that had been expected in the August Report projection. GDP was expected to grow by around 1.5% in 2021 Q3 and by 1% in Q4 in the November Report projections, around half of the rates envisaged in the August Report. While these downward revisions had mainly reflected supply chain disruption, a more modest recovery in consumer demand had also been a contributing factor. Retail sales volumes had fallen in September for the fifth month in a row, and consumer confidence had fallen in recent weeks. UK GDP was now projected to get back to its 2019 Q4 level in 2022 Q1. 52) At the Autumn Budget and Spending Review 2021, the Government had announced a higher path for government consumption, particularly over the next couple of years. These increases in spending were in addition to the higher health and social care spending announced in September alongside the new Health and Social Care Levy. Bank staff had estimated that the fiscal policies announced since the August Report would boost GDP by just over ½% at their peak in fiscal year 2023-24. 53) Over the second half of the forecast period, and conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate, UK GDP growth was expected to be relatively subdued. The pace of growth slowed as potential supply growth was expected to ease back towards pre-Covid rates, and as higher energy prices and the fading of monetary and fiscal policy support tempered demand growth. Consumption growth was expected to slow over the forecast period, in part reflecting the drag on real incomes from higher energy prices. Government spending growth was also expected to fall back, as the fiscal policy stance tightened gradually over time in line with announced government policy. Business investment was projected to rise over the first half of the forecast period as sales recovered and uncertainty declined, and was supported by the Government’s capital allowance super-deduction, before falling back. 54) Following its latest stocktake of the supply side of the economy and as set out in detail in the November Report, the Committee expected potential supply to be around 1% lower by the end of the forecast period than in August. That partly reflected an updated assessment of the impact of demographic trends on potential participation and average hours, as well as a weaker expected path for business investment, which weighed on the growth of capital and total factor productivity. 55) The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen to 4.5% in the three months to August, while Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs payroll data had continued to rise strongly. The total number of payroll employees was now estimated to be above its 2019 Q4 level, more than accounted for by a sustained increase in workers in the health, education and public administration sector over the past year. Nevertheless, LFS employment in the three months to August had been around 1½% below its pre-pandemic level, reflecting lower self employment. With measured GDP also still some way below its pre-Covid level, whole-economy labour productivity had been weak. Focusing on market-sector GDP and employment data, the average level of productivity was expected to be marginally higher by the end of the year compared to 2019 Q4. 56) The LFS inactivity rate had fallen slightly in the three months to August, but was still around 1 percentage point higher than immediately prior to the pandemic. 57) Just over a million jobs were likely to have been furloughed immediately before the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) closed at end-September, significantly more than had been expected in the August Report. Nonetheless, there had continued to be few signs of increases in redundancies and the stock of vacancies had increased further, as had indicators of recruitment difficulties. Taken together, while there was considerable uncertainty, initial indicators suggested that unemployment would rise slightly in 2021 Q4. Official labour market figures for October, the first set of LFS data covering the period following the closure of the CJRS, would be published ahead of the December MPC meeting, with further official data for 2021 Q4 published thereafter. It would be important to monitor developments in self employment and any signs of increased bankruptcies among small and medium-sized enterprises. 58) There was significant uncertainty about the degree of slack in the economy, although it was judged likely that there was a small margin of excess demand currently. Over 2022 and 2023, excess demand was expected to be eroded, as demand growth slowed by more than supply growth. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate, a margin of spare capacity was expected to emerge by the end of the forecast period. In part, that was accounted for by some spare capacity in the labour market, as the unemployment rate was expected to rise somewhat as demand growth slowed. 59) Bank staff’s estimate of underlying pay growth had remained above pre-pandemic rates. Pay settlements had continued to increase as the labour market had tightened. Underlying wage growth was, nevertheless, projected to fall back from its current rate in the November Report central projections. 60) Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen slightly from 3.2% in August to 3.1% in September. Bank staff expected inflation to rise to just under 4% in October, accounted for predominantly by the impact on utility bills of past strength in wholesale gas prices. CPI inflation was then expected to rise to 4½% in November and remain around that level through the winter, accounted for by further increases in core goods and food price inflation. Wholesale gas prices had risen sharply since August, although they had fallen back at the very end of October. CPI inflation was now expected to peak at around 5% in April 2022 in the November Report projections, materially higher than had been expected in the August Report. The path for wholesale energy prices was nevertheless very uncertain, and could change substantially over short periods of time. 61) In the November Report projections, the upward pressure on CPI inflation was expected to dissipate over time, as supply disruption eased, global demand rebalanced, and energy prices stopped rising. As a result, CPI inflation was projected to fall back materially from the second half of next year. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate and the MPC’s current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation was projected to be a little above the 2% target in two years’ time and just below the target at the end of the forecast period. In projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 0.1%, CPI inflation was forecast to be 2.8% in two years’ time. 62) Since the Committee’s previous meeting, the Citi/YouGov five-to-ten year ahead measure of household inflation expectations had fallen slightly in October, after rising sharply in September. Medium-term UK inflation compensation measures in financial markets had remained above their post-2008 average levels. Higher inflation expectations and greater perceived risks to inflation might have played a role in this, alongside other factors. Professional forecasters expected CPI inflation to be close to target in the medium term. 63) Overall, and as set out in Box C in the November Report, the MPC judged that inflation expectations remained well anchored in the United Kingdom at present. The Committee would, nevertheless, continue to monitor very closely the risk that domestic and global demand and cost pressures could affect medium-term inflation expectations, and so wage and price setting. 64) The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 65) The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy had been subject to very large shocks. Given the lag between changes in monetary policy and their effects on inflation, the Committee, in judging the appropriate policy stance, would as always focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that were likely to be transient. 66) The Committee’s best collective judgement was that the risks to the medium-term inflation projections in the November Report were broadly balanced. But this masked large risks in both directions, including among other things from energy prices and wage growth. Different MPC members placed different weights on these risks and therefore on the overall balance of risks. 67) In an alternative scenario that was conditioned on energy prices following forward curves throughout the forecast period and as set out in the November Report, CPI inflation fell back towards the target more rapidly than in the MPC’s central projection, and was materially lower over the second half of the forecast period. This alternative scenario was consistent with a general tendency for many commodity prices to revert towards their prior levels following similar large movements historically. 68) The risks around the November Report projection for wage growth to ease were judged to be skewed to the upside. Earnings growth could be boosted over the forecast period by the impact of higher current and expected inflation, if employees resisted declines in their real wages. That would be different to the experience of recent decades, including the dynamics of the labour market following the global financial crisis. It was, however, possible that there could be a break from past wage bargaining behaviour, as some aspects of the labour market were currently quite different to that period. There could also be greater than expected upward pressure on wage growth from: a continuation of a lower availability of workers, for example due to a lower path for participation or migration; sustained demand for labour from the health, education and public administration sector; or a persistence of labour market mismatch within industries or across other dimensions. 69) At its recent meetings, the Committee had judged that some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period was likely to be necessary to meet the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term. The latest developments, set alongside the Committee’s updated projections, reinforced this view. Nevertheless, near-term uncertainties remained, especially around the outlook for the labour market, and the extent to which domestic cost and price pressures persisted into the medium term. 70) At this meeting, most members of the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy, which included the previously announced £150 billion increase in the target stock of purchased assets, remained appropriate. Importantly, and as had been signalled previously, there was value in waiting for additional information on near-term developments in the labour market, including official data relating to the period following the end of the CJRS, before deciding when a tightening in monetary policy might be warranted. In addition, at least part of the downgrade in near-term UK GDP prospects since the August Report was likely to have reflected a moderation in demand, and downside risks to demand could be accentuated by the impact of higher prices on households’ real incomes. Current elevated global cost pressures were still most likely to prove transitory, leading to a one-off increase in consumer prices rather than persistently higher inflation rates. In assessing the appropriate monetary policy strategy, it was important to consider the costs, as well as the benefits, of taking out insurance against possible upside risks to medium-term inflation from second-round effects on wages and prices. As had been the case for some time, the ability to loosen monetary policy in response to any significant negative demand shock in the future was to some degree constrained by the effective lower bound of Bank Rate, whereas interest rates could be increased by as much as was needed to bring inflation back to target sustainably should any second-round effects materialise. 71) One member of the Committee joined the majority in noting a moderation in domestic and global activity, along with cross-currents in the domestic labour market and wages, energy price dynamics, and business pricing expectations affecting inflation prospects. But this member also observed a continued elevated level of risky asset prices, despite the increase in government bond yields globally. In light of this, while agreeing with the majority on maintaining Bank Rate, this member judged that it would be appropriate to remove some of the monetary stimulus to asset prices by terminating the existing asset purchase programme at this meeting, ahead of any subsequent increase in Bank Rate. 72) For two members of the Committee, the economic outlook warranted a tightening in the monetary policy stance at this meeting. These members preferred an immediate end to the existing asset purchase programme, as well as an immediate increase in Bank Rate to 0.25%. Domestic and global cost pressures had remained strong. In the United Kingdom, the labour market had tightened further, with no sign that the end of the furlough scheme had eased labour market strains. These members judged that, with the existing policy stance, CPI inflation was likely to remain above the 2% target in the medium term. This reflected a greater impact from cost pressures, especially pay growth, and the prospect of a larger and more persistent level of excess demand in the United Kingdom than in the central projection in the November Report. Maintaining the current policy stance when CPI inflation was well above target and the output gap was closed might cause medium-term inflation expectations to drift up further. A decision to tighten policy at this meeting would reduce that risk, which might otherwise ultimately necessitate a more abrupt subsequent tightening in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment. It would demonstrate the Committee’s commitment to returning inflation to target in the medium term and help to ensure that medium-term inflation expectations remained well anchored. 73) The Committee judged that, provided the incoming data, particularly on the labour market, were broadly in line with the central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report , it would be necessary over coming months to increase Bank Rate in order to return CPI inflation sustainably to the 2% target. In observing the market-implied path for Bank Rate, the Committee noted that, in the November Monetary Policy Report central projections, CPI inflation was projected to be below the 2% target at the end of the forecast period, and would probably fall a little further beyond that point, given the margin of spare capacity that was expected to emerge. 74) Looking beyond the coming months, the Committee would, as always, continue to focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The Committee judged that there were two-sided risks around developments in the economy in the medium term, and would reach its assessment on the balance of these risks in light of the relevant data as they emerged. 75) The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 0.1%; The Bank of England should maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £20 billion; The Bank of England should continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these purchases at £875 billion. Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the first proposition. Two members (Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders) voted against this proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 15 basis points to 0.25%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the second proposition. Six members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Huw Pill and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the third proposition. Three members (Catherine L Mann, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders) voted against this proposition, preferring to reduce the target for the stock of UK government bond purchases from £875 billion to £855 billion. Operational considerations 76) The existing programme of £150 billion of UK government bond purchases had started in January and its completion was expected by around the end of 2021. Further details of the planned operational approach to gilt purchases between the August and December MPC meetings had been set out in the Market Notice accompanying the August 2021 minutes. 77) The Committee would keep the asset purchase programme under review. If needed, there was scope for the Bank of England to re-evaluate the existing technical parameters of the gilt purchase programme. 78) At its September meeting, the MPC had agreed to reinvest the cash flows associated with reductions in the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases held by the Asset Purchase Facility back into eligible corporate bonds, commencing in November 2021. The Committee had subsequently been briefed by Bank staff on the approach that would be taken to making these investments in a way that took account of the climate impact of the issuers of bonds. Details of this approach would be published in the coming days, ahead of reinvestment operations commencing in late November. 79) The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Michael Saunders Silvana Tenreyro Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Diana Noble was also present on 27 October and Brad Fried was present on 2 November, as observers for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in their roles as members of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 15 December will be published on 16 December 2021.

Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 15 December 2021 ( PDF 0.4MB) PDF Close dialog Published on 16 December 2021 Monetary Policy Summary, December 2021 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 15 December 2021, the MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 to increase Bank Rate by 0.15 percentage points, to 0.25%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £20 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £875 billion, and so the total target stock of asset purchases at £895 billion. In the MPC’s central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report , global and UK GDP were expected to recover further from the effects of Covid-19 (Covid) in the near term. Conditioned on the rising path for Bank Rate expected by financial markets at that time, upward pressure on CPI inflation was expected to dissipate over time, as supply disruption eased, global demand rebalanced from goods to services, and energy prices stopped rising. Earnings growth was also expected to fall back from its current rate. As a result, inflation was projected to fall back materially from the second half of next year. Since the November MPC meeting, the Omicron Covid variant has emerged. It appears to be spreading rapidly within the United Kingdom and around the world. The new variant appears to be much more transmissible than the Delta variant and, on the basis of current knowledge, poses new risks to public health. Global risky asset prices fell in response to this news but have since largely recovered. Longer-term advanced-economy government bond yields have declined. The level of global GDP in 2021 Q4 is likely to be broadly in line with the November Report projection, but consumer price inflation in advanced economies has risen by more than expected. The Omicron variant poses downside risks to activity in early 2022, although the balance of its effects on demand and supply, and hence on medium-term global inflationary pressures, is unclear. Global cost pressures have remained strong. Bank staff have revised down their expectations for the level of UK GDP in 2021 Q4 by around ½% since the November Report, leaving GDP around 1½% below its pre-Covid level. Growth in many sectors has continued to be restrained by disruption in supply chains and shortages of labour. The impact of the Omicron variant, associated additional measures introduced by the UK Government and Devolved Administrations, and voluntary social distancing will push down on GDP in December and in 2022 Q1. The experience since March 2020 suggests that successive waves of Covid appear to have had less impact on GDP, although there is uncertainty around the extent to which that will prove to be the case on this occasion. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate fell to 4.2% in the three months to October, while the number of payrolled employees continued to rise strongly in November. There is little sign in the available data that the closure of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme at the end of September has led to a weakening in the labour market. The LFS unemployment rate is now expected to fall to around 4% in 2021 Q4, compared with the 4½% projection in the November Report. Bank staff continue to estimate that underlying earnings growth has remained above pre-pandemic rates, and the Committee continues to see upside risks around the projection for pay in the November Report. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 3.1% in September to 5.1% in November, triggering the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that is being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Relative to the November Report projection, there has been significant upside news in core goods and, to a lesser extent, services price inflation. Bank staff expect inflation to remain around 5% through the majority of the winter period, and to peak at around 6% in April 2022, with that further increase accounted for predominantly by the lagged impact on utility bills of developments in wholesale gas prices. Indicators of cost and price pressures have remained at historically elevated levels recently, and contacts of the Bank’s Agents expect further price increases next year driven in large part by pay and energy costs. CPI inflation is still expected to fall back in the second half of next year. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy has been subject to very large and repeated shocks. Given the lag between changes in monetary policy and their effects on inflation, the Committee, in judging the appropriate policy stance, will as always focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that are likely to be transient. At its November meeting, the Committee judged that, provided the incoming data, particularly on the labour market, were broadly in line with the central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report , it would be necessary over coming months to increase Bank Rate in order to return CPI inflation sustainably to the 2% target. Recent economic developments suggest that these conditions have been met. The labour market is tight and has continued to tighten, and there are some signs of greater persistence in domestic cost and price pressures. Although the Omicron variant is likely to weigh on near-term activity, its impact on medium-term inflationary pressures is unclear at this stage. The Committee judges that an increase in Bank Rate of 0.15 percentage points is warranted at this meeting. The MPC will review developments, including emerging evidence on the implications for the economy of the Omicron variant, as part of its forthcoming forecast round ahead of the February 2022 Monetary Policy Report . The Committee will, as always, continue to focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The Committee continues to judge that there are two-sided risks around the inflation outlook in the medium term, but that some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period is likely to be necessary to meet the 2% inflation target sustainably. The Committee will reach its assessment on the balance of the risks to medium-term inflation in light of the relevant data as they emerge. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 15 December 2021 1) Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2) UK-weighted world GDP was expected to grow by 0.8% in 2021 Q4, broadly in line with the projection in the November Monetary Policy Report . Supply disruptions, and an increase in Covid-19 (Covid) cases with associated measures, were expected to weigh on euro-area activity, while the US economy was expected to grow more strongly than had been anticipated. Compared to pre-Covid levels, demand for goods had continued to be strong relative to services in the United States, with US households driving almost the entire increase in durable goods consumption across G7 economies over that period. The emergence and spread of the Omicron Covid variant posed downside risks to the global recovery in activity, with the overall effect on inflation unclear. 3) In the euro area, GDP had risen by 2.2% in 2021 Q3 according to the third release, a little stronger than incorporated into the November Report, and leaving the level of GDP only 0.3% below that in 2019 Q4. Bank staff expected GDP to grow by 0.5% in the fourth quarter, slower than had been anticipated in the November Report. Even prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant, Covid cases had risen sharply across the region, and several countries had tightened measures during November and December. The composite output PMI had increased to 55.4 in November, driven by a pickup in services output, but mobility indicators had fallen back recently. Supply bottlenecks had also weighed on production, although the manufacturing output PMI had remained in expansionary territory. The euro-area unemployment rate had decreased slightly in October, to 7.3%, and euro-area wage growth had remained moderate in 2021 Q3. 4) In the United States, GDP had increased by 0.5% in 2021 Q3 according to the second estimate, weaker than had been expected in the November Report. This had left the level of GDP 1.4% higher than in 2019 Q4. In the fourth quarter, US GDP was expected to expand by 1.4%, higher than anticipated in the November Report. Household spending had grown strongly in October, although the expected rotation of demand towards services had stalled. Strength in goods spending had continued, particularly durables expenditure, which had increased again after declining earlier in the year as fiscal support had faded. In the labour market, non-farm payrolls had grown by only 210,000 in November, but the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.2%. Wage growth had picked up across a number of indicators, but had remained broadly in line with pre-Covid rates after adjusting for compositional and demographic effects. 5) In China, localised Covid outbreaks and associated measures had weighed on activity. GDP was expected to grow by 1.0% in 2021 Q4, a little below the estimate in the November Report. The housing market had continued to weaken. In other emerging markets, activity had generally picked up in 2021 Q3, although there had been differences across countries. 6) Global cost pressures had remained strong and inflation had risen by more in advanced economies than had been expected in the November Report. In November, euro-area annual HICP inflation had increased to 4.9%. US CPI inflation had reached 6.8%, consistent with PCE inflation of around 5½% in November. Strong demand for certain goods, supply disruptions and high energy prices had been behind these increases. 7) The MPC discussed the outlook for global inflation. Price pressures in the United States had broadened across sectors, and prices had not fallen back to the extent anticipated in the sectors that had previously experienced the largest increases. There had been mixed signals from early indicators of cost pressures. Wholesale gas spot prices had risen again in Europe and one-year futures prices had reached new highs. Oil and coal prices had declined from their peak, with the Brent oil spot price now around $73 per barrel. Shipping costs had remained elevated, but Chinese PMI manufacturing input prices had eased in the latest data. Indices of prices and delivery times in the United States and in the euro area had still indicated strong pressures, however, and US and euro-area companies had reported higher levels of material shortages. China’s zero-Covid strategy alongside the emergence of Omicron could also lead to renewed supply disruptions going forward if, for example, ports and factories were to close. Monetary and financial conditions 8) In response to news of the emergence and spread of the Omicron variant, global risky asset prices had fallen somewhat, but had since largely recovered. Global equity prices had declined by around 3 to 5% in the days following the initial news, with larger declines in sectors that had been most affected by previous Covid measures. Global corporate bond spreads had also widened, albeit from low levels. Implied volatilities had risen across asset classes. Overall, these moves had been relatively modest, however, and had unwound subsequently in some cases. 9) Longer-term advanced-economy government bond yields had also fallen in response to news of the Omicron variant. In the United States, some of that fall had unwound subsequently, leaving ten-year US government bond yields around 10 basis points lower overall since the MPC’s November meeting. In contrast, in the United Kingdom and the euro area, ten-year government bond yields had fallen by around 20 to 30 basis points since the Committee’s previous meeting. Those falls had largely been accounted for by a reduction in the real component of nominal interest rates. 10) The path for market-implied policy rates in the United States had risen somewhat since the MPC’s previous meeting. In part, that was likely to have reflected US CPI data and Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communications. At its 3 November meeting, the FOMC had left its target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and had begun to reduce the monthly pace of its asset purchases. The minutes of that FOMC meeting had noted that some participants preferred a somewhat faster pace of reductions that would result in an earlier conclusion to net purchases, an option which Chair Powell had noted subsequently he expected would be discussed again at the FOMC’s forthcoming meeting on 15 December. The market-implied policy rate in the United States now reached around 0.7% by end-2022 and 1.3% by end-2023, around 10 basis points higher than immediately prior to the MPC’s November meeting. In contrast, the market-implied path for policy rates in the euro area had moved down a little over the same period. 11) In the United Kingdom, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate had fallen sharply immediately following the MPC’s November meeting. Market contacts were expecting Bank Rate to rise in the coming months. In the days running up to the MPC’s December meeting, most contacts had expected Bank Rate to remain at 0.1% at this meeting. Following the UK CPI release on 15 December, however, market pricing had become more finely balanced between Bank Rate remaining at 0.1% and an increase of 15 basis points at this meeting. Further out, the market-implied path for Bank Rate reached 1.1% by the end of 2022. Volatility in UK short-term interest rate markets had remained elevated since the Committee’s previous meeting, in part reflecting diminished market liquidity, some of which was expected to persist over the year-end period. 12) Medium-term inflation compensation measures in the United Kingdom had remained above their average levels of the past decade. That contrasted with similar measures in the United States and the euro area which had been around their average levels of the past decade. 13) As the Committee had discussed at its previous meeting, interpreting UK medium-term inflation compensation measures was not straightforward. The use of UK inflation markets for hedging large pension liabilities and the uncertain future wedge between consumer price and RPI inflation meant that inflation compensation measures did not provide a direct read of market participants’ fundamental views on the inflation outlook. Nevertheless, models that attempted to extract medium-term market expectations for CPI inflation, and intelligence gathered from market contacts, suggested that higher inflation expectations and greater perceived risks to inflation might have in part accounted for the above-average levels of medium-term inflation compensation measures, alongside other factors. 14) The sterling effective exchange rate index had fallen by around 1% since the MPC’s previous meeting, with a somewhat sharper depreciation of sterling against the dollar of around 3%. 15) Moves in lending rates on UK mortgages had been mixed since the Committee’s previous meeting. Interest rates on mortgages with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at or below 75% had risen by around 30 basis points from their recent low points. This was consistent with a lagged response to the increases in risk-free rates since the autumn, with around half of those increases now having passed through to lending rates. Higher LTV mortgage rates had continued to fall since the Committee’s previous meeting, albeit at a slower pace. There had been a normalisation in housing activity measures following the end of the stamp duty holiday, while indicators of house price inflation had remained robust. 16) At its December 2021 meeting, the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) had announced an increase in the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate from 0% to 1%, coming into effect from 13 December 2022 in line with the usual twelve-month implementation period. It would also expect to increase the rate further to 2% in 2022 Q2, if the UK economic recovery proceeded broadly in line with the MPC’s central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report , and absent a material change in the outlook for UK financial stability. The FPC had also reviewed its mortgage market Recommendations, including considering how its measures had operated since they had been put in place. The FPC’s analysis had suggested that its loan to income (LTI) flow limit played a stronger role than its affordability test in guarding against an increase in aggregate household indebtedness and the number of highly indebted households when house prices rose rapidly. The FPC had therefore decided to maintain the LTI flow limit Recommendation, but to consult, in the first half of 2022, on withdrawing its affordability test. Demand and output 17) According to the ONS’s first quarterly estimate, UK GDP had risen by 1.3% in 2021 Q3, a little weaker than the 1.5% projection that had been incorporated into the November Monetary Policy Report . That had left the level of Q3 GDP 2.1% below its pre-Covid level in 2019 Q4. Within that, the initial estimates of private consumption and investment growth, which were often subject to revision, had been materially lower than expected. Total government expenditure had risen by 1.3%, higher than had been expected in the November Report. The sum of the Q3 expenditure components had been significantly less than headline GDP, indicating uncertainty surrounding the expenditure estimates and the possibility of an upward revision to spending in forthcoming releases. 18) GDP growth in October had been a little weaker than expected, at 0.1%. In both September and October, growth had been driven in part by increases in health spending, reflecting strong non-Covid activity such as doctor appointments. There had also been growth in transport and work-related activities, which had reflected the return of workers to offices and higher mobility in general. By contrast, output in some business-to-business services, such as information and communications, and finance, had weakened. Construction output had fallen in October, although this had followed a sharp rise in September. 19) Supply chain disruptions had remained acute, but did not appear to have weighed on activity by more than had been anticipated in the November Report. This was consistent with there having been little news to the level of output in those sectors that had previously been most affected by disruptions, such as manufacturing and construction. The global semiconductor shortage had continued to weigh on car production in particular, and there had been evidence that low availability had constrained new car purchases. According to the latest IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI surveys, supplier delivery times had continued to lengthen in November, and backlogs of work had continued to rise. Other indicators had also shown no easing in supply chain disruptions. The proportion of firms reporting non-labour input disruptions and significant recruitment difficulties in the November Decision Maker Panel had increased slightly, and the Bank’s Agents had reported an increase in the number of contacts reporting constraints to growth, primarily due to labour shortages but also demand for goods becoming harder to fulfil due to supply chain disruptions. An increasing number of Agents’ contacts had also reported that they expected supply issues to persist until the second half of 2022, and possibly 2023 or 2024 in some cases. 20) Retail sales volumes had increased in October, leaving the level of sales around 5½% above its pre-Covid level. Some indicators of card spending suggested retail spending had remained robust in November. The Bank’s Agents had reported companies’ concerns about being able to meet demand for Christmas, and that a lack of stock availability was reducing consumer choice. Looking ahead, the emergence and spread of the Omicron variant was likely to encourage goods, relative to services, spending, as the goods-to-income ratio had returned to around its pre-Covid level. 21) The number of Covid cases had picked up in the days leading up to the MPC’s December meeting. With the identification of the Omicron variant, measures had been put in place in England at the end of November and during the first few days of December. On 8 December, the UK Government had announced that additional measures would be introduced for England, including: guidance on working from home wherever possible; extending the legal requirement to wear a face covering to further public venues; daily testing for contacts of Omicron cases; and the introduction of Covid passes for nightclubs as well as events with large crowds. In the devolved nations, a number of measures were already in place, such as wearing face coverings in public places, advice to work from home and Covid passes. On 12 December, the UK Coronavirus alert level had been raised to level four, as transmission of the new variant was judged to be high or rising exponentially, and the UK Government had announced a plan for all those eligible in England to be offered a booster vaccine by the end of this year, while offering additional support to Devolved Administrations to accelerate their vaccination programmes. On 14 December, the UK Government had announced that it would remove the countries on the UK’s travel red list and, in Scotland, people had been advised to limit socialising to three households and physical distancing measures in shops and hospitality venues had been re-introduced. 22) There had been some tentative signs that economic activity had started to be affected by the emergence and spread of Omicron in late November. The number of OpenTable seated diners had fallen in recent weeks, although some of this had probably reflected the impact of storm Arwen at the end of November. UK retail footfall and passenger flight numbers had been flat on the weeks to 4 and 5 December respectively. However, mobility data had suggested a moderate decline in public transport use in early December. 23) Overall, Bank staff had revised down their expectations for 2021 Q4 GDP growth to 0.6%, from 1% at the time of the November Report. News to the level of GDP up to October, and the impact from Omicron and associated measures in December, meant that Bank staff now expected GDP in Q4 to be around 1½% below its 2019 Q4 level. Supply, costs and prices 24) The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had fallen to 4.2% in the three months to October, 0.2 percentage points below expectations at the time of the November Monetary Policy Report . Within that, the number of people who had been unemployed for up to six months had remained around its recent record low, although the number of people unemployed for over twelve months had remained higher than prior to the pandemic. LFS employment had increased by 0.5% in the three months to October, to 1.3% below its 2019 Q4 level, slightly weaker than expected in the November Report. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) employee payrolls had risen strongly by 257,000 in the single month of November, although these initial estimates had tended to be revised down somewhat. Payrolls growth had been revised down in October, for example, from 160,000 to 74,000. Overall, there was little sign in the available official data that the closure of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) at the end of September had led to a weakening in the labour market. Average hours worked had continued to increase in the three months to October, as those on furlough had returned to work, and were now only just over 1% below their 2019 Q4 level. The LFS inactivity rate had been unchanged in the three months to October, and was still around ¾ percentage points higher than immediately prior to the pandemic. 25) General government employment, based on returns from public sector organisations, had increased by around 219,000 in 2021 Q3 compared with its 2019 Q4 level. LFS flows data suggested that recent increases in public sector employment could be almost entirely accounted for by moves from private sector employment. 26) The stock of job vacancies recorded by the ONS had reached 1.2 million in the three months to November, and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment had also reached another record high since a consistent series had been available from 2001. Those increases appeared to reflect strong demand for labour, as labour market flows data up to 2021 Q3 had shown a similarly strong pace of new hiring. The implied average duration of vacancies and Bank staff estimates of labour market matching efficiency had been around pre-Covid levels. 27) More timely indicators of labour market activity had generally remained robust. The IHS Markit/CIPS composite employment PMI had fallen slightly in November, but had remained at a historically elevated level. The REC permanent staff placements and staff availability indices had remained close to recent record high and low levels respectively in November. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents in a range of sectors had reported wanting to take on more staff to meet increased demand, and staff turnover had remained higher than normal for many companies. Recruitment difficulties had also been reported to have become more widespread and acute, particularly for the hiring of experienced staff. Early indications following the emergence and spread of Omicron in the United Kingdom suggested that Adzuna vacancies had fallen back somewhat in the hospitality and catering sector. 28) Overall, Bank staff now expected the LFS unemployment rate to fall to around 4% in 2021 Q4, compared with the 4½% projection in the November Report. Abstracting from the risks from the impact of Omicron, it was possible that the unemployment rate could fall further over coming months if hiring continued to keep pace with the current elevated levels of vacancies. Any weakness in demand related to the new variant could offset those forces to some extent. 29) Private-sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had risen by 4.7% in the three months to October on a year earlier, weaker than earlier in the year but broadly in line with expectations at the time of the November Report. Adjusted for the mechanical effects of the CJRS and changes in composition, Bank staff estimated that private sector regular pay growth had remained at around 4½%, above pre-pandemic rates of around 3%. 30) Other pay indicators had remained strong, consistent with a continuation of the current pace of underlying earnings growth in the near term. The REC permanent staff salaries index, which measured the monthly pay growth of new permanent hires, had increased to another record high in November. Job-to-job flows had reached a record high in 2021 Q3, with particular strength in the number of voluntary resignations. Median pay growth based on HMRC payrolls data had fallen back somewhat from its peak in mid-2021. Looking ahead, a number of contacts of the Bank’s Agents expected further upward pressure on pay growth next year, in part as strength in consumer price inflation could encourage workers to demand higher pay settlements. Overall, should the labour market remain tight, there appeared to be upside risks around the projections in the November Report for earnings growth to fall back significantly over the coming year. 31) Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 3.1% in September to 5.1% in November, compared with the 4.5% figure expected in the November Report. This release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Core inflation had also risen to 4.0% in November. Relative to the November Report projection, there had been significant upside news in core goods and, to a lesser extent, services price inflation. 32) CPI inflation was expected to remain around 5% through the majority of the winter period, and peak at around 6% in April 2022. The latter would be around one percentage point higher than had been expected in the November Report. 33) The further rise in inflation next spring would in large part reflect current developments in wholesale gas and electricity futures prices, which would feed into Ofgem’s retail price caps from April. Movements in wholesale prices over much of the period following the November Report had been broadly consistent with Bank staff’s baseline assumptions of how much these caps were likely to increase, but gas and electricity futures prices had picked up sharply in the days leading up to the MPC’s meeting which implied additional upside pressure on utility price inflation if this persisted. The fall in oil prices since the MPC’s previous meeting would have a small, and only partly offsetting, negative effect on energy price inflation over coming months. 34) Core goods price inflation was expected to remain well above its pre-Covid average in the near term, accounting for the majority of the remainder of the projected above-target inflation. Services price inflation was projected to remain at above pre-Covid rates and increase somewhat further. Food price inflation was also expected to rise further, reflecting cost increases over recent months. 35) Other indicators of cost and price pressures had remained at historically elevated levels recently. Both the composite input and output price PMIs had reached new record highs in November. A short-term model constructed by Bank staff of CPI inflation excluding energy, housing, education and financial services, based on such survey indicators of price pressures, suggested some additional upside risks around the updated central projection for inflation over the next six months. The Bank’s Agents had reported that rising costs were increasingly and more frequently being passed through to prices, and that contacts expected further price increases next year driven in large part by pay and energy costs. CPI inflation was still expected to fall back in the second half of next year. 36) Since the MPC’s previous meeting, households’ one-year ahead inflation expectations had risen in the 2021 Q4 Bank/Kantar survey, but had remained unchanged in the December Citi/YouGov survey albeit at a higher level. Medium to longer-term household expectations in these surveys had picked up over recent quarters. The Citi/YouGov five to ten-year ahead measure had remained above its historical average, while the Bank/Kantar five-year ahead measure was still slightly below its historical average albeit that there was a break in this series in early 2020 due to the shift from face-to-face to online surveys. The mean response to questions on three-year and four-year ahead inflation in the HM Treasury survey of professional forecasters had increased significantly recently, but the median response was still consistent with the MPC meeting its 2% inflation target. The immediate policy decision 37) The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 38) In the MPC’s central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report , global and UK GDP had been expected to recover further from the effects of Covid in the near term. UK consumption growth had been expected to slow over the forecast period, in part reflecting the drag on real incomes from higher energy prices. Conditioned on the rising path for Bank Rate expected by financial markets at that time, upward pressure on UK CPI inflation had been expected to dissipate over time, as supply disruption eased, global demand rebalanced from goods to services, and energy prices stopped rising. Earnings growth had also been expected to fall back from its current rate. As a result, inflation had been projected to fall back materially from the second half of next year. Conditioned on the rising market path for Bank Rate at that time, CPI inflation had been projected to be a little above the 2% target in two years’ time and just below the target at the end of the forecast period. 39) Since the November MPC meeting, the Omicron Covid variant had emerged. It appeared to be spreading rapidly within the United Kingdom and around the world. The new variant appeared to be much more transmissible than the Delta variant and, on the basis of current knowledge, posed new risks to public health. 40) The Committee reviewed recent economic developments, most of which pre-dated any possible impact from the emergence and spread of the Omicron variant. 41) The level of global GDP in 2021 Q4 was likely to be broadly in line with the November Report projection, but consumer price inflation in advanced economies had risen by more than expected. The Omicron variant posed downside risks to activity in early 2022, although the balance of its effects on demand and supply, and hence on medium-term global inflationary pressures, was unclear. Global cost pressures had remained strong. Notwithstanding an apparent stabilisation in shipping prices, global supply chains had remained heavily disrupted. Companies had reported higher levels of material shortages in the United States and in the euro area. 42) Global risky asset prices had fallen in response to the emergence of the Omicron variant, but had since largely recovered. Longer-term advanced-economy government bond yields had declined. 43) Market contacts were expecting Bank Rate to rise in the coming months. In the days running up to the MPC’s December meeting, most contacts had expected Bank Rate to remain at 0.1% at this meeting. Following the UK CPI release on 15 December, however, market pricing had become more finely balanced between Bank Rate remaining at 0.1% and an increase of 15 basis points at this meeting. 44) As of 15 December 2021, the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility had reached £893 billion, including £149 billion of the £150 billion programme of UK government bond purchases announced on 5 November 2020. Including the final gilt purchase auction that was being conducted on 15 December, the programme was due to be completed by the time of the Committee’s December policy announcement. The Committee had also been briefed by Bank staff on progress towards investing the cash flows associated with reductions in the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases held by the Asset Purchase Facility back into eligible corporate bonds, which had commenced in November 2021. 45) The number of Covid cases in the United Kingdom had picked up in the days leading up to the MPC’s December meeting and, upon the identification of the Omicron variant, measures had been put in place in England and had been extended in the devolved nations. On 12 December, the Coronavirus alert level had been raised to level four, and the UK Government had announced a plan for all those eligible in England to be offered a booster vaccine by the end of this year, while offering additional support to Devolved Administrations to accelerate their vaccination programmes. 46) Bank staff had revised down their expectations for the level of UK GDP in 2021 Q4 by around ½% since the November Report, leaving GDP around 1½% below its pre-Covid level. Growth in many sectors had continued to be restrained by disruption in supply chains and shortages of labour. The impact of the Omicron variant, associated additional measures introduced by the UK Government and Devolved Administrations, and voluntary social distancing would push down on GDP in December and in 2022 Q1. The experience since March 2020 suggested that successive waves of Covid appeared to have had less impact on GDP, although there was uncertainty around the extent to which that would prove to be the case on this occasion. There had already been some tentative signs that UK economic activity had started to be affected by the emergence and spread of Omicron. As in previous Covid waves, headline GDP was still likely to be affected significantly by the ways in which public-sector output was measured in the UK national accounts. 47) The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had fallen to 4.2% in the three months to October, while the number of payrolled employees had continued to rise strongly in November. There was little sign in the available data that the closure of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme at the end of September had led to a weakening in the labour market. The LFS unemployment rate was now expected to fall to around 4% in 2021 Q4, compared with the 4½% projection in the November Report. Abstracting from the risks from the impact of the Omicron variant, it was possible that the unemployment rate could fall further over coming months if hiring continued to keep pace with the current elevated levels of vacancies. Any weakness in demand related to the new variant could offset those forces to some extent. 48) Bank staff continued to estimate that underlying earnings growth had remained above pre-pandemic rates, and the Committee continued to see upside risks around the projection for pay in the November Report. The REC permanent staff salaries index and job-to-job flows had both increased to record highs, and contacts of the Bank’s Agents expected strength in consumer price inflation to encourage workers to demand higher pay settlements. 49) Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 3.1% in September to 5.1% in November, 0.6 percentage points higher than had been expected at the time of the November Report, and triggering the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Core inflation had also risen to 4.0% in November. Relative to the November Report projection, there had been significant upside news in core goods and, to a lesser extent, services price inflation. 50) Bank staff expected inflation to remain around 5% through the majority of the winter period, and to peak at around 6% in April 2022, with that further increase accounted for predominantly by the lagged impact on utility bills of developments in wholesale gas prices. Indicators of cost and price pressures had remained at historically elevated levels recently, and contacts of the Bank’s Agents expected further price increases next year driven in large part by pay and energy costs. CPI inflation was still expected to fall back in the second half of next year. 51) Since the Committee’s previous meeting, medium-term measures of UK financial market inflation compensation had remained above their average levels over the past decade. In part, that was likely to reflect market participants’ somewhat higher central expectations for inflation. Measures of medium to longer-term household inflation expectations had picked up over recent quarters, with the Citi/YouGov five to ten-year ahead measure remaining above its historical average, while the Bank/Kantar five-year ahead measure was still slightly below its historical average though there had been a break in this series in early 2020. The median responses in surveys of professional forecasters had remained consistent with CPI inflation being close to target in the medium term. Overall, and as set out in Box C in the November Report, the MPC judged that inflation expectations remained well anchored in the United Kingdom at present. The Committee would, nevertheless, continue to monitor very closely the risk that domestic and global demand and cost pressures could affect medium-term inflation expectations, and so wage and price setting. 52) In the run-up to its policy decision, the Committee had been briefed by the Chief Medical Officer for England on recent Covid developments, including the risks to public health from the Omicron variant. 53) The Committee discussed the possible implications of recent Covid developments for the economic outlook. The MPC had noted previously the risks to the economy from a drop in vaccine effectiveness arising from viral mutations, although it was unclear currently to what extent the Omicron variant would lead to a decline in vaccine protection against severe disease. Given the clear signs of increased transmissibility for the new variant, there was the potential for a very high number of infections over a very short period. 54) It was important to note that the current position of the global and UK economies was materially different compared with prior to the onset of the pandemic, including the elevated levels of consumer price inflation. Global inflationary pressures had been influenced significantly by the shift in spending from services to durable goods that the pandemic had induced. In the MPC’s November Report forecast, it had been assumed that a rebalancing of demand would lead to a gradual reduction in the inflation rate, and in some cases the level, of the prices of traded goods. The possibility of renewed social distancing meant that this rebalancing was now more likely to be delayed and so global price pressures might persist for longer, although there were limits to how much further households’ stocks of durables were likely to rise and the responses of fiscal policy globally to the new variant was uncertain. A potential worsening of global supply chain disruption could also push up on inflationary pressures. For example, China’s current zero-Covid strategy could lead to renewed disruptions at Chinese factories and ports, and could affect shipping costs. Against that, aggregate demand could slow, reducing inflationary pressures, particularly for some consumer-facing services, and any change in expectations of future demand might lead to some loosening of labour market conditions. Demand conditions could nevertheless remain strong if households deployed savings that had been built up during the course of the pandemic to a greater extent than had been assumed in the November Report. Overall, the balance of these effects on inflation was unclear. 55) So far, successive waves of Covid had tended to have less impact on GDP and consumer spending than previous waves, but there was uncertainty around the extent to which that would prove to be the case on this occasion. Progressively more limited reductions in mobility and social interactions might have reflected the successful roll-out of vaccines and the protection that these offered against the Delta variant. The emergence of a new, partially vaccine-resistant Covid variant might therefore have a significant negative impact on consumer confidence and on economic behaviour. There could, however, also be limits to the extent to which households would adjust their behaviour further. For example, a large number of employees had continued to work from home prior to the recent change in government guidance, growth in consumer spending on restaurants had continued to be supported by sales of take-away and delivery food in addition to seated dining, and online retail sales had remained strong. More generally, spending less on one category of consumption did not necessarily mean a like-for-like reduction in total spending. Such aggregate consumption decisions should be more closely related to household expectations of future income, including expectations beyond the point at which the pandemic was likely to be at its immediate peak. 56) The outlook for UK activity, and the balance of the effects of the Omicron variant on demand and supply, would also depend on the responses of other policymakers in the United Kingdom and abroad. 57) The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 58) The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognised that there will be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy had been subject to very large and repeated shocks. Given the lag between changes in monetary policy and their effects on inflation, the Committee, in judging the appropriate policy stance, would as always focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that were likely to be transient. 59) At its November meeting, the Committee had judged that, provided the incoming data, particularly on the labour market, were broadly in line with the central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report , it would be necessary over coming months to increase Bank Rate in order to return CPI inflation sustainably to the 2% target. Recent economic developments suggested that these conditions had been met. The labour market was tight and had continued to tighten, and there were some signs of greater persistence in domestic cost and price pressures. Although the Omicron variant was likely to weigh on near-term activity, its impact on medium-term inflationary pressures was unclear at this stage. 60) At this meeting, most members of the Committee judged that an immediate, small increase in Bank Rate was warranted. Although the conditions for tightening set out in November had been met, the decision at this meeting was finely balanced because of the uncertainty around Covid developments. There was some value in waiting for further information on the degree to which Omicron was likely to escape the protection of current vaccines and on the initial economic effects of this new wave. There was, however, also a strong case for tightening monetary policy now, given the strength of current underlying inflationary pressures and in order to maintain price stability in the medium term. The economic impact of the new variant could, in some scenarios, increase these inflationary pressures further. Moreover, maintaining the current monetary policy stance when CPI inflation was materially above the 2% target and the output gap appeared to be closed might cause medium-term inflation expectations to drift up further. 61) One member of the Committee judged that, were it not for the emergence of the Omicron variant, an increase in Bank Rate could have been appropriate at this meeting. However, the significant uncertainty introduced by Omicron warranted waiting until February for more clarity before considering any change in Bank Rate. UK output remained below its 2019 Q4 level and further below the trend for potential. The new variant and renewed voluntary social distancing would unambiguously slow economic activity, but would have two-sided effects on inflation. The overall effect of Omicron on the short-term trade-off between inflation and output, and on the medium-term prospects for inflation, would depend critically on the transmissibility, vaccine resistance and severity of the variant, but also on the overall policy response, both domestically and abroad. Some scenarios would call for tighter monetary policy, while others would require a somewhat longer period of accommodation. In line with risk management concerns owing to the asymmetry of available monetary policy tools, this member preferred to wait for further evidence that the recovery remained entrenched, and was not threatened materially by the new variant, before tightening monetary policy. 62) The MPC would review developments, including emerging evidence on the implications for the economy of the Omicron variant, as part of its forthcoming forecast round ahead of the February 2022 Monetary Policy Report . The Committee would, as always, continue to focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The Committee continued to judge that there were two-sided risks around the inflation outlook in the medium term, but that some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period was likely to be necessary to meet the 2% inflation target sustainably. The Committee would reach its assessment on the balance of the risks to medium-term inflation in light of the relevant data as they emerged. 63) The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.15 percentage points, to 0.25%; The Bank of England should maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £20 billion; The Bank of England should maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £875 billion. Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders) voted in favour of the first proposition. Silvana Tenreyro voted against this proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the second and third propositions. 64) The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Michael Saunders Silvana Tenreyro Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Bradley Fried and Diana Harding were also present on 10 December, as observers for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in their roles as members of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 2 February will be published on 3 February 2022.

Monetary Policy Report - February 2022 Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 2 February 2022 ( PDF 0.4MB) PDF Close dialog Published on 03 February 2022 Monetary Policy Summary, February 2022 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 2 February 2022, the MPC voted by a majority of 5-4 to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.5%. Those members in the minority preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 0.75%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to begin to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets. The Committee also voted unanimously for the Bank of England to begin to reduce the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets and by a programme of corporate bond sales to be completed no earlier than towards the end of 2023 that should unwind fully the stock of corporate bond purchases. The Committee’s updated central projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying February Monetary Policy Report. The projections are conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rises to around 1½% by the middle of 2023. Wholesale energy prices are assumed to follow their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projections and remain constant beyond that, in contrast to futures curves, which are downward sloping over coming years. There are material risks around this assumption. Global and UK activity returned to their pre-Covid-19 (Covid) levels towards the end of last year. The emergence of the Omicron variant is expected to have depressed activity somewhat in December and January. But its economic impact is likely to be limited and of short duration, and UK GDP is expected to recover in February and March such that output returns to its pre-pandemic level once again by the end of the first quarter. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in the three months to November, and is expected to fall further in the near term, to 3.8% in 2022 Q1. Beyond the near term, UK GDP growth is expected to slow to subdued rates. The main reason for that is the adverse impact of higher global energy and tradable goods prices on UK real aggregate income and spending. As a result, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 5% and excess supply builds to around 1% by the end of the forecast period. Underlying earnings growth is estimated to have remained above pre-pandemic rates, and is expected to strengthen over the coming year, to around 4¾%. This is consistent with the results of the Bank’s Agents’ annual pay survey, with the tight labour market, and with some temporary upward pressure on wage settlements from higher price inflation. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 5.1% in November to 5.4% in December, almost 1 percentage point higher than expected at the time of the November Report. Inflation is expected to increase further in coming months, to close to 6% in February and March, before peaking at around 7¼% in April. This projected peak is around 2 percentage points higher than expected in the November Report. The projected overshoot of inflation relative to the 2% target mainly reflects global energy and tradable goods prices. The further rise in energy futures prices meant that Ofgem’s utility price caps were expected to be substantially higher at the reset in April 2022. Core goods CPI inflation is also expected to rise further, due to the impact of global bottlenecks on tradable goods prices. In the February Report central projection, upward pressures on CPI inflation are expected to dissipate over time, as global energy prices are assumed to remain constant after six months, and as global bottlenecks ease and tradable goods prices fall back a little. Underlying wage growth is also projected to ease from 2023, as the labour market loosens gradually and inflation declines. Conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate and the MPC’s current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation is projected to fall back to a little above the 2% target in two years’ time and to below the target by a greater margin in three years. In an alternative scenario that is conditioned on energy prices following forward curves throughout the forecast period and as set out in the February Report, excess supply is around ½ percentage point lower in the medium term than in the MPC’s central projection, and CPI inflation is around ¾ percentage point below the 2% target in two and three years’ time. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy has been subject to very large and repeated shocks. In particular, should recent movements prove persistent, the sharp rises in prices of global energy and tradable goods of which the United Kingdom is a net importer will necessarily weigh on UK real aggregate income and spending. This is something monetary policy is unable to prevent. The role of monetary policy is to ensure that, as such a real economic adjustment occurs, it does so consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. Given the current tightness of the labour market and continuing signs of greater persistence in domestic cost and price pressures, the Committee judges that an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points is warranted at this meeting. Consistent with the MPC’s guidance set out in the August 2021 Report, the Committee agrees at this meeting that the Bank of England should cease to reinvest any future maturities falling due from its stock of UK government bond purchases. This reflects the MPC’s intention to reduce its holdings of government bonds in a gradual and predictable manner. In addition, the Committee agrees that the Bank of England should cease to reinvest any maturities falling due from its stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, and that it should initiate a programme of corporate bond sales to be completed no earlier than towards the end of 2023 that should unwind fully the stock of corporate bond purchases. The decision to initiate the programme of corporate bond sales reflects the specific characteristics of the corporate bond market and the MPC’s involvement in it, and should not be taken as a signal regarding the commencement, scale or duration of any potential future UK government bond sales programme. The Committee reaffirms that it will consider beginning the process of actively selling UK government bonds only once Bank Rate has risen to at least 1%, and depending on economic circumstances at the time. The Committee also reaffirms its preference in most circumstances to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. The extent of any further tightening in monetary policy will depend on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The MPC judges that, if the economy develops broadly in line with the February Report central projections, some further modest tightening in monetary policy is likely to be appropriate in the coming months. The Committee continues to judge that there are two-sided risks around the medium-term inflation outlook, primarily from wage developments on the upside and from energy and global tradable goods prices on the downside. The Committee will update its assessment on the balance of the risks to medium-term inflation in light of the relevant data as they emerge. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 2 February 2022 1. Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the backdrop of its latest economic projections, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2. UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.8% in 2021 Q4, as had been expected in the November Monetary Policy Report. In 2022 Q1, global GDP was expected to grow more slowly than had been anticipated in the November Report, as the Omicron Covid variant had led to renewed restrictions and voluntary social distancing in many countries. However, the uncertainty relating to the economic impact of Omicron had declined, and its economic consequences were likely to be more limited and of shorter duration than had been anticipated at the time of the MPC's December meeting. Global cost pressures, arising from the strength in goods demand and supply chain disruptions as well as high energy prices, had remained elevated and had also weighed on activity over past months. Strong demand for goods, in particular in the United States, had appeared to have been a more important determinant of global bottlenecks than supply chain disruptions over recent months. 3. According to the preliminary flash estimate, euro-area GDP had increased by 0.3% in 2021 Q4, such that output had returned to its 2019 Q4 level. This was weaker than had been expected in the November Report, due to tighter restrictions to address rising Covid case numbers in November and December in several countries, driven initially by the Delta variant and subsequently by Omicron. The unemployment rate had fallen to 7.0% in December, a historical low. Omicron case numbers had increased going into 2022 and, as a result, euro-area output was expected to contract slightly in the first quarter. Notwithstanding restrictions starting to ease in some countries, recent indicators had pointed to weakness in Covid-sensitive sectors with the flash services activity PMI falling back in January. The manufacturing output PMI had picked up, possibly suggesting some stabilisation in supply constraints, particularly in Germany. 4. According to the advance estimate, US GDP had grown by 1.7% in 2021 Q4, implying that output had been around 3% above its 2019 Q4 level. This had reflected a stronger recovery than had been anticipated in the November Report, as the economic impact of the Delta variant had waned. Growth in the fourth quarter had been accounted for primarily by stockbuilding. Consumption had also supported growth, and there had been evidence for a continuing rotation of household spending from goods to services. The labour market had appeared tight at the end of 2021. The unemployment rate had fallen to 3.9% in December, the lowest level since February 2020, as participation rates had remained below pre-Covid levels and the number of job vacancies had continued to be high relative to historical levels. More recent high-frequency card spending data suggested that there had been a relatively temporary disruption to spending related to Omicron around the turn of the year, with limited restrictions in place. In 2022 Q1, GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%. 5. In China, GDP had increased by 1.6% in 2021 Q4, stronger than had been expected in the November Report. Year-on-year industrial production growth had increased in December, reflecting an easing of power shortages and of some input constraints, as well as strong external demand. However, consumption indicators had continued to be somewhat weaker than measures of production, with year-on-year retail sales growth slowing, as localised Covid outbreaks and associated restrictions weighed on domestic demand. The recent outbreaks appeared to have had a relatively limited impact on the supply capacity of the economy but, looking ahead, there was uncertainty as to whether the more transmissible Omicron variant might cause greater supply disruptions, to the extent that China maintained its current Covid strategy. The housing market had continued to slow. 6. Consumer price inflation had remained elevated in the euro area and the United States. Euro-area annual HICP inflation had increased to 5.1% in January, significantly above market expectations immediately ahead of the release, while core inflation had fallen to 2.3%. In the United States, annual PCE inflation had risen to 5.8% in December, with core inflation increasing to 4.9%. High energy prices had driven most of the pickup in consumer price inflation over the fourth quarter in the euro area, while price pressures were more broadly based in the United States, with strong contributions from energy, cars, accommodation and other core goods. This suggested that, in addition to high energy prices, pressures from global bottlenecks due to strong demand for goods and inelastic supply had been passing through to consumer prices. There had also been some divergence in wage growth between the United States and the euro area. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s measure, US wage growth had continued to increase in the fourth quarter, to somewhat above its pre-Covid rate, while wage growth in the euro area had remained muted in the third quarter. 7. The MPC discussed the central case for, as well as risks to, the global inflation outlook. In the near term, there would likely be further pass-through to consumer price inflation from past cost increases. Since the MPC’s December meeting, signals from cost indicators had been mixed. Energy prices had been volatile. Wholesale gas spot prices had initially fallen back in Europe from their peak in mid-December, but had recently risen again amid increasing geopolitical tensions. The Brent oil spot price had risen by $19 per barrel since the MPC’s previous meeting, to $91. Measures of shipping costs had been mixed, with some easing and others increasing once more. Indices of global input prices and delivery times had plateaued, suggesting some stabilisation in global bottlenecks at high levels. Overall, global bottlenecks were expected to ease over the next twelve months as spending in the United States rotated back to services, a little later than had been anticipated in the November Report. There was, however, a risk that the demand rotation could be delayed further, for example if consumer preferences had shifted more permanently. Supply chains could also be further disrupted in the event of widespread factory and port closures in China in response to Covid developments. Should these risks materialise, consumer prices could rise further than anticipated. Alternatively, it was possible that global cost pressures abated more quickly and to a greater extent in the medium term than expected, in which case consumer price inflation might moderate at a faster pace as well. Monetary and financial conditions 8. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, advanced-economy government bond yields had risen significantly. Ten-year yields had increased by around 35 to 60 basis points in the United States, euro area and United Kingdom, reaching their highest levels since the onset of the pandemic. These increases had been accounted for primarily by real rates. The increases in nominal yields had reflected higher estimated term premia across countries, with a high degree of comovement between yields across different economies. 9. The path for market-implied policy rates in the United States had risen significantly since the MPC’s previous meeting. At its 26 January meeting, the FOMC had left its target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and had continued to reduce the monthly pace of its asset purchases, as well as publishing additional information regarding its principles for significantly reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. The market-implied policy rate in the United States reached around 1¼% by end-2022, around 50 basis points higher than immediately prior to the MPC’s December meeting. In the euro area, the near-term market-implied path for policy rates had moved down a little over the same period. At its meeting on 16 December, the ECB Governing Council had left its key policy interest rates unchanged, and had announced a gradual reduction in the pace of net asset purchases. 10. In the United Kingdom, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate over the year ahead had risen, with market pricing consistent with an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points, to 0.5%, at this MPC meeting. The February Monetary Policy Report was conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate, based on the 15-working day average to 26 January, that rose to around 1½% by mid-2023. In the immediate run-up to the MPC’s February meeting, the market-implied path for Bank Rate had reached around 1.7% by mid-2023. The results of the Bank of England’s new Market Participants Survey, which would be published for the first time on the Friday following the release of these minutes, had painted a broadly similar picture of Bank Rate expectations: respondents had widely expected a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate at this meeting; a large majority expected Bank Rate to reach 1% within the next year; and respondents assessed that the balance of risks around this near-term path was skewed to the upside. Respondents expected reinvestments of the Bank’s holdings of UK government bonds to cease after the anticipated Bank Rate increase at this meeting. 11. Medium-term inflation compensation measures in the United Kingdom had increased slightly since the MPC’s previous meeting and had remained above their average levels of the past decade, in contrast to similar measures in the United States and the euro area, which had been around their average levels of the past decade. As the Committee had discussed previously, interpreting UK medium-term inflation compensation measures was not straightforward. Nevertheless, models that attempted to extract medium-term market expectations for CPI inflation, and intelligence gathered from market contacts, suggested that higher inflation expectations and greater perceived risks to inflation might have in part accounted for these above-average levels of medium-term inflation compensation measures, alongside other factors. This was consistent with results from the Market Participants Survey, which had suggested that respondents attributed these levels in part to elevated inflation expectations, but also to technical factors, such as those arising from the fact that inflation markets were used for hedging large pension liabilities, and an upside balance of risks around the inflation outlook. 12. The sterling effective exchange rate had risen by around 2% since the previous MPC meeting. The US dollar had, in contrast, fallen by around ½%, despite a relatively large increase in US government bond yields. 13. Equity prices had fallen after the MPC’s previous meeting, before recovering. The initial fall had reflected the increase in government bond yields, as well as the impact of geopolitical developments. Overall, equity prices had ended the period lower in the United States, while in the United Kingdom they had increased somewhat, cushioned by an estimated fall in equity risk premia. This in part had reflected the composition of the FTSE All Share index, including its skew towards sectors that had been supported by the recent rise in energy prices. Across countries, there had been stronger performance in those sectors more exposed to Covid, relative to those more exposed to higher interest rates. There had been less adjustment in the corporate bond market, as spreads had remained at historically low levels, having reversed the modest increases seen in response to the initial emergence of Omicron. 14. Lending rates on mortgages with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at or below 75% had increased further since the MPC’s previous meeting. This was broadly consistent with a lagged response to the increases in risk-free rates in the fourth quarter of 2021, with around half of those increases having passed through to lending rates. The subsequent further increases in risk-free rates seen since the December MPC meeting would be expected to feed through to mortgage lending rates in due course. Other components of household borrowing, such as credit cards and personal loans had been less sensitive, as would be expected. Demand and output 15. UK quarterly GDP growth in 2021 Q3 had been revised down slightly in the Quarterly National Accounts, from 1.3% to 1.1%. The level of GDP had, however, been revised up by around ½%, with that news more than accounted for by a higher path of household consumption throughout the pandemic. In the third quarter, consumption had risen by 2.7%, while the saving ratio had fallen back to 8.3%. Business investment had fallen by 2.5% in Q3, with particular weakness in the air transport sector, and had remained well below its pre-Covid level in 2019 Q4. 16. GDP was estimated to have risen by 0.9% in November, stronger than had been expected by Bank staff. Combined with the upward revisions to GDP, this meant that, prior to the onset of the Omicron variant, aggregate activity had regained its pre-pandemic level for the first time. GDP had been almost 1% higher than expected at the time of the November Monetary Policy Report. Within the November output data, activity had been stronger than expected across most sectors of the economy, including consumer-facing, transport and professional services. There had also been tentative signs in the manufacturing and construction sectors that supply disruptions were starting to ease, although monthly data could be volatile. 17. Bank staff expected GDP to have fallen by around ½% in December, largely due to the impact of the Omicron variant towards the end of the month, but to have risen by just over 1% during 2021 Q4 as a whole. Retail sales volumes had fallen quite sharply in December, according to official data, in part reflecting the unwind of previous strength, as consumers appeared to have brought forward some purchases ahead of the holiday season, and as Omicron had weighed on activity. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported that shortages of some goods due to continuing supply-chain issues had not constrained aggregate spending by as much as had been anticipated. Nevertheless, staff shortages, exacerbated by absences due to sickness or self-isolation, were reported to have curtailed activity across a number of sectors. 18. Having reached a very high level around the turn of the year, the number of Covid cases had fallen back, and had then appeared to have stabilised. On 21 December, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had announced that additional support would be available for businesses who were impacted by the Omicron variant, including one-off grants of up to £6,000 per premise for businesses in the hospitality and leisure sectors in England, and that the Government would cover the cost of Statutory Sick Pay for Covid-related absences for small and medium-sized employers across the United Kingdom. In the run-up to this MPC meeting, the UK Government and Devolved Administrations had announced a number of relaxations to Covid measures, some of which had been put in place in response to the Omicron variant. These had included the lifting of Plan B measures in England during the second half of January, and the removal of post-arrival testing requirements for fully vaccinated travellers into the United Kingdom from 11 February. 19. Recent high-frequency indicators suggested that activity had rebounded somewhat since early January, including in consumer-facing services and work-related travel. This was consistent with intelligence from the Bank’s Agents that the peak economic impacts of the Omicron variant had passed quickly. GfK consumer confidence had nevertheless fallen in January, probably due to initial concerns around the impact of Omicron. Despite the incipient squeeze on real household disposable incomes, households’ views of their own financial situation had, so far, held up relatively well. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had noted, however, that they expected pressure on household incomes to dampen consumer spending in the coming months. Overall, Bank staff expected GDP to recover further in February and March, such that the economy was projected to return to its pre-pandemic level of activity once again by the end of the first quarter, and that GDP on average would be unchanged between 2022 Q1 and 2021 Q4. Market sector GDP was expected to surpass its November 2021 level by March. 20. Although the number of companies reporting skilled labour shortages as a constraint on output in the January CBI Industrial Trends survey had remained very elevated, the number of companies reporting materials shortages as a factor limiting production had fallen back somewhat from its highest level since the mid-1970s, and the January manufacturing PMIs had suggested that supply constraints were not worsening as much as in previous months. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents expected only a slow improvement in supply chain disruption through 2022, and some continued to judge that problems could persist into 2023. There had also been increasing reports of slower investment growth due to shortages of goods, machinery and labour. There had, nevertheless, been widespread strength in investment intentions reported to the Agents, with contacts highlighting the reinstatement of projects that had been paused during the pandemic, and the need to increase capacity to meet demand. After weakening in December, the January Decision Maker Panel had reported a smaller drag from Covid on business investment over the first half of this year. Supply, costs and prices 21. The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen to 4.1% in the three months to November, 0.4 percentage points lower than had been expected at the time of the November Monetary Policy Report. The LFS employment rate had been broadly as expected, however, as inactivity had unexpectedly risen slightly. The number of inactive people who reported wanting a job had continued to fall. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) employee payrolls had risen by a further 184,000 in the single month of December, although these initial estimates had tended to be revised down somewhat. Bank staff judged that both the LFS employee and HMRC payroll series were around their 2019 Q4 levels after accounting for an unusually high number of individuals having switched from self-employment and onto payrolls, associated in part with tax reforms. Self-employment had remained weak even accounting for these estimates of switching, such that LFS employment was 1.4% below its 2019 Q4 level in the three months to November. Indicators of labour market tightness had nevertheless remained elevated. The ratio of vacancies to unemployment had increased to another record high since a consistent series had begun in 2001. 22. Bank staff expected the LFS unemployment rate to fall further to 3.8% in 2022 Q1, despite the spread of Omicron weighing on activity at the beginning of the quarter. The flash composite employment PMI for January had been broadly unchanged on the month, remaining well above its past historical average. The Bank’s Agents had reported a modest easing in employment growth, in part due to recruitment difficulties having remained intense. High-frequency indicators of online vacancies had dipped during December and had begun to recover in January, but that profile had been comparable to the seasonal pattern prior to the pandemic. Instead of weaker labour demand, the main counterpart in the labour market to Covid-related weakness in activity had appeared to be an increase in staff absences due to sickness, self-isolation or caring responsibilities. The ONS Business Insights and Conditions Survey suggested that around 3% of the workforce had been absent for Covid-related reasons around the turn of the year. The Agents’ contacts had begun to see a reduction in absences, however, and generally viewed Omicron as a temporary issue. 23. Growth in private-sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had slowed to 4.1% in the three months to November on a year earlier, broadly in line with Bank staff expectations ahead of the release. Pay growth had been boosted by the mechanical effects of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and changes in the composition of the workforce, but those effects had waned in recent months. Adjusting for these effects, Bank staff estimated that underlying private-sector regular pay growth had remained at around 4 to 4½%, above pre-pandemic rates of around 3 to 3½%. The median of pay growth based on HMRC payrolls data was around 3%, comparable to pre-pandemic rates, implying that recent pay awards had been more skewed towards the upside than in the recent past. That was broadly consistent with the Bank’s Agents’ contacts reporting that pay increases had been significantly higher for workers with skills in short supply. 24. In the February Report projection, underlying private-sector pay growth was expected to pick up further in coming quarters. A special survey of firms conducted by the Bank’s Agents suggested that the average pay settlement was expected to rise to close to 5% in 2022, with the pickup broadly based across different sectors of the economy and firms of different sizes. Contacts had cited the ability to retain staff and recruit new workers, and increases in consumer price inflation, as factors that had pushed up their expectations for pay. The REC permanent staff salaries index, which measured the monthly pay growth of new permanent hires, had also remained close to record highs in December. Headline AWE growth was expected to be somewhat lower than the underlying rate, as the past boost to pay from compositional effects was assumed to continue to fade, although there was uncertainty around the precise scale and speed of any such unwind. 25. Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 5.4% in December, almost 1 percentage point above the November Report forecast. The upside news had been spread across a number of components, particularly within core goods. Strength in core goods prices, alongside higher energy prices, had also accounted for much of the absolute overshoot in inflation relative to the 2% target. Services price inflation had moved further above its pre-Covid rate. Price increases had been particularly acute for second-hand cars and hospitality, replicating trends in the United States. 26. CPI inflation was projected to increase further in coming months, to close to 6% in February and March and peaking at around 7¼% in April when higher utility price caps were due to be implemented. This projected peak was around 2 percentage points higher than had been expected in the November Report. In addition to the upside news in the CPI data to December, wholesale gas and electricity futures prices had increased further, putting upward pressure on utility prices. The costs of the Supplier of Last Resort mechanism, covering the losses that energy companies had incurred from taking on customers from failed suppliers, were also expected to begin to be passed on to household energy bills. The annual ONS update of the CPI weights was anticipated by Bank staff to lead to an increase in CPI inflation in the near term, in part due to greater weight being placed on energy prices. Certain contract prices, such as for telecommunication services, that were indexed to consumer price measures were also due to increase in coming months. 27. Survey indicators of costs and prices, such as the flash composite input and output price PMIs for January, had remained at historically elevated levels. The Bank’s Agents had reported that the costs of some raw materials and shipping rates on some routes appeared to be stabilising, but that higher energy and wage costs were putting additional upward pressure on prices. The Agents’ pay survey had suggested that around 70% of companies were expecting to increase their prices due to current wage pressures, although that share was lower among consumer-facing firms. 28. Measures of households’ and companies’ short-term inflation expectations had risen further since the MPC’s previous meeting. The Citi/YouGov household measure of expectations for the year ahead had increased from 4.0% in December to 4.8% in January, although the five-to-ten year ahead measure was unchanged. Respondents to the Decision Maker Panel had increased their expectations for their own price increases over the next twelve months from 4.2% in the survey covering the three months to November to 4.5% for the three months to January. Professional forecasters continued to expect CPI inflation to be close to the 2% target two and three years ahead. The immediate policy decision 29. The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 30. The Committee reviewed recent developments against the backdrop of its updated central projections for activity and inflation as set out in the accompanying February Monetary Policy Report. The projections were conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rose to around 1½% by the middle of 2023. Wholesale energy prices were assumed to follow their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projections and remain constant beyond that, in contrast to futures curves, which were downward sloping over coming years. There were material risks around this assumption. 31. UK-weighted world GDP in 2021 Q4 was estimated to have grown in line with expectations in the November Report. In 2022 Q1, global GDP was expected to grow more slowly, but the uncertainty relating to the economic impact of Omicron had declined, and its economic consequences were likely to be more limited and of shorter duration than had been anticipated at the time of the MPC's December meeting. In the February Report projections, global activity continued to grow thereafter, but was restrained by higher global energy prices over the forecast period, and by the impact of ongoing supply chain constraints for tradable goods over the coming year. 32. Consumer price inflation had risen further in the United States and the euro area since the Committee’s previous meeting. Global cost pressures, arising from the strength in goods demand and supply chain disruptions as well as high energy prices, had also remained elevated. Wholesale gas spot prices had initially fallen back in Europe from their peak in mid-December, but had recently risen again amid increasing geopolitical tensions. Oil prices had risen significantly. Strong demand for goods, in particular in the United States, had appeared to have been a more important determinant of global bottlenecks than supply chain disruptions over recent months. In the February Report projections, world export prices were expected to rise a little further in the near term. As global bottlenecks eased, global tradable goods prices were expected to fall a little over the forecast period, though to remain well above their pre-pandemic levels. 33. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, advanced-economy government bond yields had increased significantly. Market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate had risen, with market pricing consistent with an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points, to 0.5%, at this MPC meeting. The results of the Bank of England’s Market Participants Survey, which would be published for the first time on the Friday following the release of these minutes, had painted a broadly similar picture of Bank Rate expectations. 34. Having reached a very high level around the turn of the year, the number of Covid cases had fallen back in the United Kingdom, and had then appeared to have stabilised. In the run-up to this MPC meeting, the UK Government and Devolved Administrations had announced a number of relaxations to Covid measures, some of which had been put in place in response to the Omicron variant. The MPC’s projections were conditioned on the assumptions that no material restrictions on economic activity were re-imposed, and that there was no further widespread voluntary social distancing, following this wave. 35. UK GDP was estimated to have risen by 0.9% in November. Combined with upward revisions to GDP, this meant that, prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant, aggregate activity had regained its pre-pandemic level for the first time. The Omicron variant was expected to have depressed activity somewhat in December and January. But its economic impact was likely to be limited and of short duration, and GDP was expected to recover in February and March such that output returned to its pre-pandemic level once again by the end of the first quarter. 36. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had fallen to 4.1% in the three months to November, 0.4 percentage points lower than had been expected at the time of the November Report. It was expected to fall further in the near term, to 3.8% in 2022 Q1, despite the spread of Omicron weighing on activity at the beginning of the quarter. The ratio of vacancies to unemployment had increased, to another record high. Most indicators of the balance of demand and supply in the economy suggested that there was currently a small margin of excess demand across the economy as a whole. 37. Beyond the near term, UK GDP growth was expected to slow to subdued rates. The main reason for that was the adverse impact of higher global energy and tradable goods prices on UK real aggregate income and spending. 38. Consumption growth was expected to slow, as households cut back on spending in the face of the material adverse effects on their real incomes from the sharp rises in global energy and tradable goods prices, and the planned increase in national insurance contributions in April 2022. Although consumption growth therefore slowed materially over the first two years of the forecast period, it remained above income growth. That reflected an assumption that households would spend some of the significant additional savings that they had accumulated, in aggregate, during the pandemic. As a result, the household saving rate was expected to fall from 8.3% in 2021 Q3 to below 4% from the end of 2022. There were risks in both directions around this projection. Given the windfall nature of the excess savings built up during the course of the pandemic, households could be more willing to spend out of these to support their level of real consumption. Set against that, existing savings were more concentrated among higher earners, who might generally spend proportionately little out of their savings. Developments in energy prices in particular could also disproportionately affect those households with lower savings. 39. In the February Report projections, a margin of excess supply was expected to emerge later this year and to build over the forecast period. In part, that was accounted for by some slack in the labour market, with the unemployment rate expected to rise to around 5% by the end of the projection. 40. Underlying earnings growth was estimated to have remained above pre-pandemic rates, and was expected to strengthen over the coming year, to around 4¾%. This was consistent with the results of the Bank’s Agents’ annual pay survey, with the tight labour market, and with some temporary upward pressure on wage settlements from higher price inflation. 41. Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 5.1% in November to 5.4% in December, almost 1 percentage point higher than had been expected at the time of the November Report. The upside news had been spread across a number of components, particularly within core goods. Strength in core goods prices, alongside higher energy prices, had accounted for much of the absolute overshoot in inflation relative to the 2% target. Services price inflation had moved further above its pre-Covid rate. 42. CPI inflation was expected to increase further in coming months, to close to 6% in February and March, before peaking at around 7¼% in April. This projected peak was around 2 percentage points higher than expected in the November Report. Three-quarters of the projected increase in inflation between December and April was expected to reflect higher contributions from energy and goods prices. Survey indicators of costs and prices had remained at historically elevated levels. 43. The HM Treasury representative had briefed the Committee on the Government’s policy plans in response to Ofgem’s forthcoming price cap announcement. 44. In the February Report central projection, upward pressures on CPI inflation were expected to dissipate over time, as global energy prices were assumed to remain constant after six months, and as global bottlenecks eased and tradable goods prices fell back a little. Underlying wage growth was also projected to ease from 2023, as the labour market loosened gradually and inflation declined. Conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate and the MPC’s current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation was projected to fall back to a little above the 2% target in two years’ time and to below the target by a greater margin in three years. In projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 0.5%, CPI inflation was expected to be 2.6% and 2.1% in two and three years’ time respectively. 45. In an alternative scenario that was conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate and energy prices following forward curves throughout the forecast period, and as was set out in the February Report, excess supply was around ½ percentage point lower in the medium term than in the MPC’s central projection, and CPI inflation was around ¾ percentage point below the 2% target in two and three years’ time. 46. Measures of households’ and companies’ short-term inflation expectations had risen further since the MPC’s previous meeting. Measures of inflation expectations two to three years ahead, as well as some longer-term measures derived from household surveys and financial markets, had also increased in recent months, but by less than short-term measures. Professional forecasters continued to expect CPI inflation to be close to the 2% target two and three years ahead. A risk to the inflation outlook was that longer-term inflation expectations evolved such that wage and price setting were not consistent with inflation returning to the 2% target in the medium term. Overall, the MPC judged that inflation expectations remained well anchored at present. The Committee would, nevertheless, continue to monitor measures of inflation expectations very closely. 47. In Box A of the August 2021 Monetary Policy Report, the Committee had set out its strategy for the mix of monetary policy instruments to deliver tighter policy, including its preference in most circumstances to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. The Committee had noted that it intended to begin to reduce the stock of UK government bonds, by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets, when Bank Rate reached 0.5% and if appropriate given the economic circumstances. This would have the benefit of providing a predictable and gradual path for the reduction in the stock of government bonds. The MPC would also consider actively selling some of the stock of government bonds only once Bank Rate had risen to at least 1%, and depending on economic circumstances at the time. The Box had stated that the MPC would take a separate decision on the corporate bond portfolio in due course. 48. In the run-up to this MPC meeting, the Committee had considered its strategy for reducing the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases. It judged that ceasing reinvestments and, in addition, initiating a programme of corporate bond sales at the point Bank Rate reached 0.5%, would appropriately reflect the specific characteristics of the Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (CBPS). It also judged that this would not have implications for the unwinding of the UK government bond portfolio, which would continue to be governed by the framework set out in Box A in the August Report. 49. The CBPS, at £20 billion, was far smaller than the stock of UK government bonds held by the APF, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of their respective markets. The MPC therefore judged that the impact on monetary conditions of unwinding the stock of corporate bonds, at a time when markets were functioning normally, was likely to be relatively small. 50. The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 51. The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy had been subject to very large and repeated shocks. In particular, should recent movements prove persistent, the sharp rises in prices of global energy and tradable goods of which the United Kingdom was a net importer, would necessarily weigh on UK real aggregate income and spending. This was something monetary policy was unable to prevent. The role of monetary policy was to ensure that, as such a real economic adjustment occurred, it did so consistent with achieving the 2% CPI inflation target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. 52. Given the current tightness of the labour market and continuing signs of greater persistence in domestic cost and price pressures, all members of the Committee judged that an increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. Different members placed different weights on the arguments for an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 or of 0.5 percentage points at this meeting. 53. Five members judged that a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. The February Report projections implied that some tightening in monetary policy was required to bring inflation back to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. However, the forecast also incorporated a material trade-off related to the continuing global energy and tradable goods price shock, with CPI inflation expected to remain materially above the target in the first half of the forecast, at the same time as a margin of spare capacity was opening up. After the second year, conditioned on the market path for Bank Rate, CPI inflation was projected to fall below the target due to that widening margin of spare capacity. In the scenario in which energy prices followed their forward curves throughout the forecast period, inflation was projected to undershoot the target by ¾ percentage point in two and three years’ time. These members recognised the risks from the possibility of stronger domestic wage and price pressures in the near term, but also saw a need to balance this against the potential for inflation to fall more quickly and to a greater extent than expected if energy and other tradable goods prices followed a lower path than in the MPC’s central projection. There was also a case for moving Bank Rate in small increments; a larger increase at this meeting could have an outsized impact on expectations for the further path of policy, which was already sufficient, in the central projection, to push inflation well below the target in year three of the forecast. 54. Four members judged that a 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. Monetary policy had been very accommodative, and capacity pressures were now widespread, especially in the labour market. The projected path for CPI inflation was again being revised up over the first two years of the forecast period, while medium-term inflation expectations remained relatively high and on some measures had increased further. Companies responding to the Decision Maker Panel had indicated that they expected to raise prices significantly in 2022. The strong pickup in pay settlements reported to the Bank’s Agents, and the recent broadening from goods price to services price inflation, suggested that these developments were now being reflected in domestic costs and prices, which could make CPI inflation more persistent than was expected in the February Report central projection. Monetary policy should tighten to a greater extent at this meeting in order to reduce the risk that recent trends in pay growth and inflation expectations became more firmly embedded and thereby help to bring inflation back to the target sustainably in the medium term. 55. Consistent with the MPC’s guidance set out in the August 2021 Report, and given that financial markets were functioning normally, the Committee agreed at this meeting that the Bank of England should cease to reinvest any future maturities falling due from its stock of UK government bond purchases. This reflected the MPC’s intention to reduce its holdings of government bonds in a gradual and predictable manner. 56. In addition, the Committee agreed that the Bank of England should cease to reinvest any maturities falling due from its stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, and that it should initiate a programme of corporate bond sales to be completed no earlier than towards the end of 2023 that should unwind fully the stock of corporate bond purchases. 57. The decision to initiate this programme of corporate bond sales reflected the specific characteristics of the corporate bond market and the MPC’s involvement in it, and should not be taken as a signal regarding the commencement, scale or duration of any potential future UK government bond sales programme. The Committee reaffirmed that it would consider beginning the process of actively selling UK government bonds only once Bank Rate had risen to at least 1%, and depending on economic circumstances at the time. 58. The Committee also reaffirmed its preference in most circumstances to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. The Committee agreed that, as a matter of course, it would not continue to vote at each meeting on propositions regarding the stock of purchased assets, at least until any decision concerning sales of UK government bonds. If potential movements in Bank Rate were judged insufficient to achieve the inflation target, or if prevailing conditions were ones in which asset purchases might be particularly effective, the reductions in the stock of purchased assets could be amended or reversed. 59. The extent of any further tightening in monetary policy would depend on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The MPC judged that, if the economy developed broadly in line with the February Report central projections, some further modest tightening in monetary policy was likely to be appropriate in the coming months. The Committee continued to judge that there were two-sided risks around the medium-term inflation outlook, primarily from wage developments on the upside and from energy and global tradable goods prices on the downside. The Committee would update its assessment on the balance of the risks to medium-term inflation in light of the relevant data as they emerged. 60. The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.5%; The Bank of England should begin to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets; The Bank of England should begin to reduce the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets and by a programme of asset sales to be completed no earlier than towards the end of 2023 that should unwind fully the stock of corporate bond purchases. Five members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Huw Pill and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the first proposition. Four members (Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders) voted against this proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 0.75%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the second and third propositions. Operational considerations 61. At its September 2021 meeting, the MPC had agreed to reinvest the cash flows associated with reductions in the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases held by the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) back into eligible corporate bonds, commencing in November 2021. The Committee had been briefed at its February meeting on this programme of reinvestments completed in the run-up to the meeting and undertaken in line with the approach to greening set out in the Bank of England's announcement in November 2021. 62. As of 2 February 2022, the total stock of assets held in the APF was £895 billion, comprising £875 billion of UK government bond purchases and £20 billion of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases. 63. Consistent with the Committee’s decision at this meeting to begin to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases, the £27.9 billion of cash flows associated with the redemption of the March 2022 gilt held by the APF would not be reinvested. 64. In total over 2022 and 2023, just over £70 billion of UK government bonds held by the APF would mature, and over 2024 and 2025 around a further £130 billion of bonds would mature. Details of the full maturity profile of APF-owned government bonds would be set out on the Bank of England’s website, which would be kept updated to ensure that the general public and financial markets had clear information on how the size of the APF was scheduled to evolve. 65. As the stock of purchased assets began to fall, the Bank of England would continue to monitor money market functioning closely, and would stand ready to adjust reserves in either direction if judged necessary to facilitate the smooth transmission of monetary policy. 66. Consistent with the decision at this meeting to begin to reduce the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, the Committee asked Bank staff to design a programme of corporate bond sales, details of which would be announced within three months. The programme would be designed so as not to disrupt the functioning of the sterling investment-grade corporate bond market. Further details, including the initial schedule of operations, would be set out in a Market Notice to be published ahead of the start of sales. 67. The Governor had written a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer setting out some of these considerations. In addition, the letter highlighted that it was appropriate for the Government indemnity associated with the APF to reduce in size progressively, in line with the reduction in the stock of purchased assets. 68. The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Michael Saunders Silvana Tenreyro Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. 69. As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Ron Kalifa was also present on 26 and 28 January, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 16 March will be published on 17 March 2022.

Published on 17 March 2022 Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 16 March 2022 ( PDF 0.4MB) PDF Close dialog Monetary Policy Summary, March 2022 The Bank of England condemns Russia’s unprovoked invasion and the suffering inflicted on Ukraine. The Bank is working closely with the UK Government to support its response in coordination with international authorities. The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) supports this condemnation and welcomes these actions. The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 16 March 2022, the MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.75%. One member preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%. In the MPC’s central projections in the February Monetary Policy Report, published before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, UK GDP growth was expected to slow to subdued rates during the course of this year. This in large part reflected the adverse impact of the previous, already large, increases in global energy and tradable goods prices on UK real aggregate income and spending. As a result, a margin of spare capacity was projected to open up and the unemployment rate to rise to 5% by 2025. CPI inflation was expected to peak at around 7¼% in April 2022. Upward pressures on inflation were expected to dissipate over time and, conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate expected at the time of the February Report and the MPC’s current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation was projected to fall back to a little above the 2% target in two years’ time and to below the target by a greater margin in three years. Developments since the February Report are likely to accentuate both the peak in inflation and the adverse impact on activity by intensifying the squeeze on household incomes. Regarding inflation, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has led to further large increases in energy and other commodity prices including food prices. It is also likely to exacerbate global supply chain disruptions, and has increased the uncertainty around the economic outlook significantly. Global inflationary pressures will strengthen considerably further over coming months, while growth in economies that are net energy importers, including the United Kingdom, is likely to slow. Turning to economic activity, UK GDP in January was stronger than expected in the February Report. Business confidence has held up and labour market activity data have remained robust. Consumer confidence has, however, fallen in response to the squeeze on real household disposable incomes. That impact on real aggregate income is now likely to be materially larger than implied by the projections in the February Report, consistent with a weaker outlook for growth and employment, all else equal. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 5.4% in December to 5.5% in January, which triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that is being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Inflation is expected to increase further in coming months, to around 8% in 2022 Q2, and perhaps even higher later this year. The projected overshoot of inflation relative to the 2% target to an increasing extent reflects global energy prices, with some further material contribution from tradable goods prices. Service price inflation has also picked up, although to a lesser extent than other components, with core services prices returning to their pre-Covid trend. Underlying nominal earnings growth is estimated to have remained above pre-pandemic rates, and is still expected to strengthen over the coming year. If sustained, the latest rise in energy futures prices means that Ofgem’s utility price caps could again be substantially higher when they are reset in October 2022. This could temporarily push CPI inflation around the end of this year above the level projected for April, which was previously expected to be the peak. Further out, inflation is expected to fall back materially, as energy prices stop rising and as the squeeze on real incomes and demand puts significant downward pressure on domestically generated inflation. That judgement also reflects that monetary policy will act to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored around the 2% target. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is another such shock. In particular, should recent movements prove persistent, the very elevated levels of global energy and tradable goods prices, of which the United Kingdom is a net importer, will necessarily weigh further on UK real aggregate income and spending. This is something monetary policy is unable to prevent. The role of monetary policy is to ensure that, as this real economic adjustment occurs, it does so consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. Given the current tightness of the labour market, continuing signs of robust domestic cost and price pressures, and the risk that those pressures will persist, the Committee judges that an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points is warranted at this meeting. Based on its current assessment of the economic situation, the Committee judges that some further modest tightening in monetary policy may be appropriate in the coming months, but there are risks on both sides of that judgement depending on how medium-term prospects for inflation evolve. The MPC will review developments in the light of incoming data and their implications for medium-term inflation, including the economic implications of recent geopolitical events, as part of its forthcoming forecast round ahead of the May 2022 Monetary Policy Report. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 16 March 2022 1: The Bank of England condemned Russia’s unprovoked invasion and the suffering inflicted on Ukraine. The Bank was working closely with the UK Government to support its response in coordination with international authorities. The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) supported this condemnation and welcomed these actions. 2: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 3: The global economic outlook had deteriorated significantly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, and the associated material increase in the prices of energy and raw materials. These price increases would further raise global consumer and producer price inflation in the near term from already high rates, and erode real aggregate income for net commodity-importing countries. Renewed supply chain problems were also likely to emerge as production of, and trade in, important inputs declined, due both to the physical disruption caused by the invasion and the effects of sanctions imposed on Russia. 4: GDP growth in the United States and in the euro area in 2021 Q4 had been broadly in line with expectations in the February Report, and was expected to be slightly stronger in 2022 Q1 than had been anticipated, particularly in the euro area. Euro-area PMIs had picked up sharply in February, indicating that the economic impact of the Omicron Covid variant had been less severe than expected. In the United States, household consumption had rebounded in January, although the rotation from goods to services spending had stalled. Unemployment rates had fallen further in the euro area and the United States at the turn of the year, and wage growth had continued to rise in the United States according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s measure. 5: Chinese activity data for January and February combined, including industrial production and retail sales, had been stronger than expected, reflecting a smaller impact from the Omicron Covid variant at that time. Following a rapid pickup in Covid cases in Hong Kong accompanied by a high mortality rate, Covid cases had, however, started rising again in China, and Chinese authorities had continued to react with tight local restrictions in line with the country’s current Covid strategy. There had been reports of factories stopping production in response, which could lead to supply disruption and weigh on economic activity. 6: Even prior to the most recent increases in energy prices, consumer price inflation had been high in many economies. Euro-area annual HICP inflation had increased to 5.8% in February, with core inflation at 2.7%. US annual CPI inflation had risen to 7.9% in February, and core inflation to 6.4%. The headline US CPI figure was consistent with annual PCE inflation around 6½%. In the euro area, HICP inflation had been driven in large part by increases in energy prices over recent months, in particular gas prices. Contributions to US CPI inflation had been broad-based across components: within core services, rent and healthcare price rises had contributed particularly strongly, while increases in car and household goods prices had pushed core goods inflation higher. 7: Since the invasion, commodity prices had increased substantially, while exhibiting marked volatility. Russia was a significant exporter of gas, supplying around 40% of the gas used in the euro area, and was also the second largest global crude oil producer. Concerns that gas flows to Europe might be disrupted had led to exceptional volatility in European wholesale gas prices. Those prices had risen sharply following the invasion from already elevated levels in early March, with the Dutch Title Transfer Facility spot price rising to around €240 per MWh, before declining again to around €115 per MWh at the time of the MPC’s meeting, around 40% above the average spot price assumed in the February Report. The futures curve six months out was a little below current spot prices. The spot price of Brent crude oil had also been volatile and had increased by around 17% since the February Report, to around $100 per barrel at the time of the MPC’s meeting, in part driven by announcements by the US and UK governments that they would curtail oil imports from Russia. 8: Russia and Ukraine were also major producers of other raw materials, and prices of metals and food had risen by around 15 and 20% respectively since the February Report. Russia accounted for a significant proportion of global pig iron, steel, nickel, aluminium and copper exports that were a key input to many production processes. There had been reports of some car manufacturers having to shut European plants because of a lack of inputs from the region. Russia and Ukraine also accounted for almost 30% of the world’s wheat exports and Russia supplied 16% of the world’s fertiliser. Ukraine was a major producer of neon, which was a key input for the production of semiconductors, potentially leading to renewed supply pressures in this sector. 9: The increases in energy and other raw material prices were expected to boost global consumer price inflation significantly in the near term, directly through fuel, utilities and food prices, and indirectly through firms’ costs. Supply chain disruption could also add further upward pressure to goods prices. Given Europe’s reliance on Russian gas, and the fragmentation of the global market which meant that US gas prices had not increased materially, the effect was expected to be larger in the euro area and in the United Kingdom. Higher prices would reduce real incomes, exacerbating the policy challenges facing central banks around the world. 10: The Russian economy was expected to be affected significantly by sanctions. Financial sanctions announced shortly after the invasion began had been aimed at hindering trade with Russia, through restricting the ability of some Russian banks to process foreign transactions, particularly in dollars, and through curtailing access of some Russian banks to the SWIFT messaging service, which made it more costly to process transactions. Transactions with the Central Bank of Russia had also been prohibited, restricting its ability to use its international reserves to support the rouble, facilitate cross-border trade and service debt. More recently, the United States had announced a ban on Russian oil imports, the United Kingdom had declared that it would phase out its imports of Russian oil by the end of this year, and the European Union had set out plans to cut its gas use by the end of this year by around two-thirds of its gas imports from Russia in 2021. There had also been a wave of voluntary withdrawals of companies from activities in Russia. This had not only involved high profile consumer-facing firms, but also a broader range of companies supplying goods and services to the Russian business sector and mining companies. In late February, the Central Bank of Russia had raised interest rates from 9.5 to 20%, had ordered exporters to surrender 80% of their foreign exchange receipts, and had restricted the ability of residents to take capital out of the country. The rouble had fallen by around 25% since the start of the invasion. Central and Eastern European currencies had depreciated by 3 to 6%, and the Polish and Hungarian central banks had raised interest rates. Central and Eastern European countries had experienced a significant influx of refugees from Ukraine. Monetary and financial conditions 11: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, indicators of financial market volatility had increased and risky asset prices had fallen, reflecting the expected global impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Advanced economy equity prices had fallen significantly and spreads on corporate bonds had widened. Option-implied distributions of equity prices suggested that these movements reflected increased pricing of downside risks to equity prices, as well as a shift down in central case expectations. 12: Short-term financial market inflation compensation measures had increased across advanced economies, in large part reflecting the impact of the invasion on energy prices. Medium-term measures had also increased over the same period. It was common for these measures to move together, but recent movements in medium-term measures were nevertheless noteworthy, given that oil and gas futures curves were consistent with energy price inflation falling back significantly beyond the near-term horizon. 13: In the United Kingdom, the increases in medium-term inflation compensation measures had taken their levels further above their average of the past decade. As the Committee had discussed previously, interpreting UK medium-term inflation compensation measures was not straightforward. The use of UK inflation markets for hedging large pension liabilities and the uncertain future wedge between consumer price and RPI inflation meant that inflation compensation measures did not provide a direct read of market participants’ fundamental views on the inflation outlook. Nevertheless, models that attempted to extract medium-term market expectations for CPI inflation, and intelligence gathered from market contacts, suggested that higher inflation expectations and greater perceived risks of inflation persistence had probably accounted for above-average levels of UK medium-term inflation compensation measures, alongside other factors. 14: The sterling effective exchange rate had fallen by 1.7% since the previous MPC meeting, and to a greater extent against the US dollar. 15: The near-term path for market-implied policy rates in the United States had risen since the MPC’s previous meeting, although some of this increase had pre-dated the invasion. The market-implied policy rate in the United States reached a little under 2% by end-2022, around 50 basis points higher than immediately prior to the MPC’s February meeting. In the euro area, the near-term market implied path for policy rates had also risen since the MPC’s previous meeting. At its meeting on 10 March, the ECB Governing Council had left its key policy interest rates unchanged, but had announced a faster reduction in the pace of net asset purchases. 16: In the United Kingdom, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate over the year ahead had risen, with market pricing consistent with an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points, to 0.75%, at this MPC meeting. The market-implied path for Bank Rate now reached around 2% by end-2022, around 70 basis points higher than immediately prior to the MPC’s February meeting. The latest Bank of England Market Participants Survey suggested that respondents expected a slightly shallower path for Bank Rate than the market-implied path over the next couple of years, but a greater number of respondents viewed the balance of risks around that path as being skewed to the upside rather than to the downside. 17: Longer-term advanced economy government bond yields had increased since the MPC’s previous meeting. 18: UK bank lending rates on mortgages with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at or below 75% had risen further since the MPC’s previous meeting. This was broadly consistent with a lagged response to the increases in risk-free rates since the autumn of 2021. Lending rates on some higher LTV mortgages had also started to increase. However, rates on higher LTV mortgages had, on the whole, remained lower than in autumn 2021, reflecting the normalisation of spreads in this market, which had increased significantly at the start of the pandemic. The subsequent further increases in risk-free rates that had occurred since the February MPC meeting would be expected to feed through to mortgage lending rates in due course. Interest rates on unsecured household borrowing, such as credit cards and personal loans had, as usual, been less sensitive to changes in reference rates. Demand and output 19: The MPC had been briefed on initial reports from the Bank’s Agents and Decision Maker Panel on business sentiment following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. But there was little evidence available yet on the impact of the invasion on UK economic activity. The squeeze on real post-tax labour income would, nevertheless, be materially larger than expected previously, due to recent commodity price increases. 20: According to the ONS’s first quarterly estimate, UK GDP had increased by 1.0% in 2021 Q4, broadly in line with the expectation incorporated into the February Monetary Policy Report projection and close to the level of activity prior to the onset of the pandemic in 2019 Q4. Household consumption and business investment had risen by around 1% on the quarter, with government expenditure growing more strongly than those components. Business investment had remained more than 10% below its pre-Covid level, however. 21: Following a 0.2% decline in December, GDP had risen by 0.8% in January, notably stronger than had been expected at the time of the February Report, and to a level 0.5% higher than in 2019 Q4. Government services output had been stronger than expected, accounted for by health activity including NHS Test and Trace. GDP growth in January had been broad based across the service, manufacturing and construction sectors. Output in consumer-facing services had risen by 1.8%, broadly in line with expectations at the time of the February Report. This was consistent with other higher-frequency indicators and with a very limited economic impact on high-contact sectors from the Omicron Covid variant. 22: Since the Committee’s previous meeting, there had been further relaxations, and in some cases removals, of Covid measures announced by the UK Government and Devolved Administrations. Recent high-frequency economic indicators suggested that activity in high-contact sectors was on track to return to its pre-Omicron levels during the first quarter of the year. Data on card spending, restaurant reservations, train journeys and flights had continued to recover strongly over recent weeks. 23: Bank staff now expected GDP to increase by around ¾% in 2022 Q1, stronger than the February Report projection for a flat quarterly outturn. This nowcast assumed that some of the surprising strength in non-Covid related activity in recent months persisted through the quarter. 24: Prior to the invasion in late February, there had already been tentative signs that the squeeze on real disposable incomes was starting to weigh on the household sector. Although aggregate retail sales volumes had risen strongly in January, food sales had fallen to below pre-pandemic levels as food prices had risen. Notably, GfK consumer confidence had declined materially in February, with the weakness most pronounced in the forward-looking personal financial situation component. It was, however, unclear whether that represented downside news relative to the weakness in real incomes and spending that had been factored into the February Report projections. Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that consumer spending had continued to grow at a robust pace. However, contacts were concerned about the outlook for demand over the coming months, due to increasing pressures on households’ real disposable incomes. 25: Housing market activity had remained robust, and indicators of house prices had surprised on the upside relative to the February Report projections. 26: Recent indicators of corporate sector sentiment had been somewhat more resilient than consumer confidence, although these had generally been collated prior to the invasion. The IHS Markit/CIPS composite output PMI in February had risen to its highest level since June 2021. There had also been signs in the manufacturing and construction PMIs that supply chain disruptions had eased further. Nevertheless, the latest intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that the invasion was expected to exacerbate shortages of some tradable goods and could affect the production plans of some sectors, such as the automotive industry. And on the demand side, early results from the March Decision Maker Panel suggested that around one third of companies viewed the invasion as one of the top three sources of uncertainty for their business, with an average negative impact across all firms of around 3% on sales expectations over the next twelve months. 27: The Chancellor of the Exchequer would present the Spring Statement to Parliament on 23 March, alongside updated Office for Budget Responsibility projections in its Economic and fiscal outlook. Supply, costs and prices 28: Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 5.5% in January, marginally above the February Monetary Policy Report forecast. This release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. 29: Taken together, energy and core goods inflation had accounted for over four fifths of the overshoot of CPI inflation relative to the 2% target in January. Food price inflation had strengthened further and accounted for much of the remainder of the overshoot. 30: The Government’s Energy Bills Rebate, a package of support for households worth around £9 billion, had been announced after the MPC’s February meeting and the completion of the February Report projections. This package included a £150 payment to most households via council tax bills in April, and a £200 credit to households administered via electricity bills from October and repaid over the subsequent five-year period. The ONS’s announcements on the treatment of these elements of this package in official consumer price measures were forthcoming. 31: CPI inflation was expected to rise to around 6% in February and March, before rising further, to around 8% in April, and remaining close to that rate for the rest of the quarter. The latter would be around 1 percentage point higher than expected in the February Report. The majority of this news could be attributed to energy prices. This included Ofgem’s announcement of slightly higher than expected increases in gas and electricity price caps in April, which were based on wholesale gas and electricity prices that pre-dated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In addition, recent increases in oil prices associated with the invasion were being reflected in prices of petrol and heating oil. Wholesale gas prices had been exceptionally volatile and the six-month observation window relevant for Ofgem’s October utility price cap calculation, which would run from February to the end of July, had only recently opened. If sustained, the latest rise in gas and electricity futures prices would mean that price caps, when reset in October 2022, could be around 35% higher, which would be around 20% higher than had been expected in the February Report. 32: Food price inflation was expected to rise further, from 4.3% in January, reflecting the pass-through of cost increases over recent months. Indicators of cost pressures further down the food supply chain had continued to rise. Following the invasion, agricultural commodity prices had increased sharply, which could put further upward pressure on input costs and food price inflation. 33: Core CPI inflation was expected to rise further, to around 5 to 5½% in 2022 Q2 accounted for largely by increases in core goods price inflation. Core goods inflation was expected to remain above its average during the previous decade. Services price inflation was projected to increase slightly, above recent historical averages. The overall near-term profile for core inflation was slightly higher than the expectation at the time of the February Report. Global supply chain disruptions posed an upside risk to the outlook for core goods price inflation. 34: Survey indicators of cost and price pressures had remained elevated. Both the IHS Markit/CIPS PMI composite input and output price measures had remained close to their historical highs. But these indicators pre-dated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and were likely to understate the consequent cost pressures associated with the invasion. More timely intelligence from the Bank’s Agents’ contacts suggested that input prices had picked up further since late February, in particular for metals, grain and seed oils. 35: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, households’ and businesses’ inflation expectations had risen further. Both the Bank/Ipsos and the Citi/YouGov surveys had reported a further rise in households’ short-term inflation expectations in 2022 Q1. The rise in the latter in March had been particularly pronounced, reaching its highest level since the survey had begun in late 2005. Changes in households’ short-term inflation expectations had typically corresponded with changes in spot inflation, especially developments in the prices of frequently purchased items, such as food, fuel and utilities. Medium-term measures of households’ inflation expectations had also increased further, though by less than their short-term counterparts. Nevertheless, the Citi/YouGov five-to-ten year ahead measure had matched its previous record high recorded in June 2011. 36: The Decision Maker Panel had reported a further increase in expectations for businesses’ year-ahead output price inflation, which had risen to 4.8% in the three months to February, and risen slightly further in the early March data particularly for those respondents who had viewed the invasion as the largest source of uncertainty for their businesses. The expectations of professional forecasters, reported in HM Treasury’s February survey, had remained close to the inflation target of 2% at the two- to three-year ahead horizons. 37: The latest labour market indicators had continued to point to a tight and tightening labour market, which, alongside rising inflation, had contributed to strong pay growth. 38: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen to 3.9% in the three months to January, as had been expected at the time of the February Report. The LFS employment rate had been unchanged, with the inactivity rate rising slightly. Both developments had been broadly consistent with expectations at the time of the February Report. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) employee payrolls had risen strongly, by a further 275,000 in February, although these initial estimates had tended to be revised down somewhat subsequently. 39: Indicators of labour demand had remained strong. The stock of vacancies in the three months to February had risen to 1.3 million, supplanting the record high set in the preceding three-month period. The REC permanent placements index had remained close to its record high in February. The vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, a measure of labour market tightness, had remained above pre-Covid levels and had reached a new record high level. Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that elevated recruitment difficulties had persisted across most sectors and skill levels. The Agents’ contacts had reported high rates of job churn and vacancies, with little improvement in labour availability expected over the next year. 40: Private-sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth had risen to 4.1% in the three months to January on a year earlier, stronger than had been expected in the February Report. Bank staff estimated that workforce compositional effects had started to drag on headline pay growth recently. Adjusted for the mechanical effects of the changes in workforce composition and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, Bank staff estimated that underlying private sector regular pay growth had remained at around 4 to 4½%, above pre-pandemic rates of around 3 to 3½%. The HMRC median of pay growth in February had been 3.7%, also above pre-pandemic rates. Looking ahead, the latest intelligence from the Bank’s Agents continued to point to higher pay settlements than a year ago, consistent with the Agents’ recent annual pay survey. The immediate policy decision 41: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 42: In the MPC’s central projections in the February Monetary Policy Report, published before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, UK GDP growth had been expected to slow to subdued rates during the course of this year. This had in large part reflected the adverse impact of the previous, already large, increases in global energy and tradable goods prices on UK real aggregate income and spending. As a result, a margin of spare capacity had been projected to open up and the unemployment rate had been expected to rise to 5% by 2025. CPI inflation had been expected to peak at around 7¼% in April 2022. Upward pressures on inflation had been expected to dissipate over time and, conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate expected at the time of the February Report and the MPC’s current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation had been projected to fall back to a little above the 2% target in two years’ time and to below the target by a greater margin in three years. 43: The Committee reviewed recent economic news, against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and related developments. 44: Based on available economic data for the period prior to the invasion, UK-weighted global GDP in 2022 Q1 was expected to grow by a little more than had been expected in the February Report, particularly in the euro area. Global consumer price inflation had risen further in February, to 5.8% in the euro area and to 7.9% in the United States. 45: The invasion had led to further large increases in energy and other commodity prices including food prices. It was also likely to exacerbate global supply chain disruptions, and had increased the uncertainty around the economic outlook significantly. Global inflationary pressures would strengthen considerably further over coming months, while growth in many of the United Kingdom’s major trading partners, such as the euro area and other economies that were net energy importers, was likely to slow. 46: Gas prices in Europe had risen sharply following the invasion from already elevated levels, before declining again. The spot price of Brent oil had also been volatile and had increased to around $100 per barrel at the time of the MPC’s meeting. Prices of metals and food had risen by around 15 and 20% respectively, and by a greater amount for those commodities of which Russia or Ukraine were major exporters. 47: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, indicators of financial market volatility had increased and advanced economy risky asset prices had fallen. Longer-term advanced economy government bond yields had increased. 48: In the United Kingdom, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate over the year ahead had risen, with market pricing consistent with an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points at this MPC meeting. The market-implied path for Bank Rate now reached around 2% by end-2022. 49: The Government’s Energy Bills Rebate had been announced after the MPC’s February meeting and the completion of the February Report projections. The ONS’s announcements on the treatments of the elements of this package in consumer price statistics were forthcoming. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would present the Spring Statement to Parliament on 23 March, alongside updated Office for Budget Responsibility projections in its Economic and fiscal outlook. 50: The MPC had been briefed on initial reports from the Bank’s Agents and Decision Maker Panel on business sentiment following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But there was little evidence available yet on the impact of the invasion on UK economic activity. 51: UK GDP in January had been stronger than expected in the February Report. Bank staff now expected GDP to increase by around ¾% in 2022 Q1, stronger than the February Report projection for a flat quarterly outturn. Business confidence had held up and labour market activity data had remained robust. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had fallen to 3.9% in the three months to January, as expected at the time of the February Report. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs employee payrolls had risen strongly in February, although these initial estimates had tended to be revised down somewhat subsequently. The vacancy-to-unemployment ratio had risen to another record high, and indicators of recruitment difficulties had remained elevated. Consumer confidence had, however, fallen in response to the squeeze on real household disposable incomes. Developments in the labour market were also likely to lag those in confidence and spending. 52: Due to recent developments, the impact of energy prices on real aggregate income was now likely to be materially larger than implied by the projections in the February Report, consistent with a weaker outlook for growth and employment, all else equal. The extent to which households reacted to the additional weakness in their real incomes by cutting their real spending or by reducing their savings would be important to monitor over coming quarters. The aggregate saving rate had already declined materially from its pandemic-driven peak over recent quarters, although it could fall below its pre-Covid level if some households were to run down the additional stock of savings built up during the pandemic. Developments in energy prices were likely to affect disproportionately households with lower incomes. Those households had not in general seen substantial rises in savings during the pandemic, however, which would limit the extent of any offset from a rundown of savings. It would also be important to monitor the extent to which higher uncertainty led to a reduction in business investment. 53: Underlying nominal earnings growth was estimated to have remained above pre-pandemic rates in the three months to January, and was higher than had been expected in the February Report. The latest intelligence from the Bank’s Agents continued to point to higher pay settlements than a year ago, consistent with the Agents’ recent annual pay survey. 54: Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 5.4% in December to 5.5% in January, which had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. Inflation was expected to increase further in coming months, to around 8% in 2022 Q2, around 1 percentage point higher than expected in the February Report. The majority of this news could be attributed to energy prices. The projected overshoot of inflation relative to the 2% target to an increasing extent reflected global energy prices, with some further material contribution from tradable goods prices. Service price inflation had also picked up, although to a lesser extent than other components, with the level of core services prices returning to their pre-Covid trend. Survey indicators of cost and price pressures had remained elevated. 55: If sustained, the latest rise in energy futures prices meant that Ofgem’s utility price caps could again be substantially higher when they were reset in October 2022. Wholesale prices had, however, been exceptionally volatile and the six-month observation window relevant for the October price cap calculation, which would run from February to the end of July, had only recently opened. Such movements could nevertheless temporarily push CPI inflation around the end of this year above the level projected for April, which had previously been expected to be the peak. Such an outturn could be several percentage points higher than had been expected in the February Report. In addition, continuing global supply chain disruptions posed an upside risk to the outlook for core goods inflation. 56: Further out, inflation was expected to fall back materially, and possibly to a greater extent than had been expected in the February Report, as energy prices stopped rising and as the squeeze on real incomes and demand put significant downward pressure on domestically generated inflation. The recent increase in the market-implied path of Bank Rate would also push down on demand and inflation in the medium term relative to the February Report, all else equal. The judgement that inflation would fall back also reflected that monetary policy would act to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were well anchored around the 2% target. 57: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, financial market, household and business indicators of inflation expectations had risen. Medium-term UK inflation compensation measures in financial markets had increased further above their averages of the past decade. The Citi/YouGov measure of households’ five-to-ten year ahead expectations had matched its previous record high level. The Decision Maker Panel had reported a further increase in expectations for businesses’ year-ahead output price inflation. Nonetheless, the expectations of professional forecasters, had remained close to the 2% target at the two to three year ahead horizon. Overall, the MPC judged that inflation expectations remained well anchored at present. A risk to the inflation outlook was that wages and prices would not be set in a manner consistent with inflation returning to the 2% target in the medium term. The Committee would continue to monitor measures of inflation expectations very closely. 58: The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 59: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy had recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was another such shock. In particular, should recent movements prove persistent, the very elevated levels of global energy and tradable goods prices, of which the United Kingdom was a net importer, would necessarily weigh further on UK real aggregate income and spending. This was something monetary policy was unable to prevent. The role of monetary policy was to ensure that, as this real economic adjustment occurred, it did so consistent with achieving the 2% CPI inflation target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. 60: Given the current tightness of the labour market, continuing signs of robust domestic cost and price pressures, and the risk that those pressures would persist, most members of the Committee judged that a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. UK activity had been somewhat stronger than had been expected at the time of the February Report and there had been indications that the current tightening in the labour market might not reverse direction as quickly as had been expected. The effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would likely accentuate both the peak in inflation and the adverse impact on activity by intensifying the squeeze on household incomes. Monetary policy should be tightened at this meeting in order to reduce the risk that recent trends in nominal pay growth, domestic pricing, and inflation expectations strengthened and became embedded, and thereby to help to ensure inflation was at target sustainably in the medium term. 61: For one member of the Committee, it was appropriate to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy at this meeting. This member recognised the risk of second-round effects from a protracted period of high inflation and a tight labour market and that, as a consequence, further policy tightening might be warranted. This member, however, also placed great weight, at this point, on the very material negative impacts of higher commodity prices on real household incomes and activity. These appeared to have been exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The invasion could also increase uncertainty and decrease consumer and business confidence. Such impacts on activity and employment would push against domestic inflationary pressures. For this member, the path of monetary policy would depend upon a fuller assessment than currently possible of the balance between these pressures, especially given current volatility in commodity markets. 62: Based on its current assessment of the economic situation, the Committee judged that some further modest tightening in monetary policy might be appropriate in the coming months, but there were risks on both sides of that judgement depending on how medium-term prospects for inflation evolved. The MPC would review developments in the light of incoming data and their implications for medium-term inflation, including the economic implications of recent geopolitical events, as part of its forthcoming forecast round ahead of the May 2022 Monetary Policy Report. 63: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.75%. 64: Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden, Michael Saunders and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the proposition. Jon Cunliffe voted against the proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%. Operational considerations 65: As of 16 March 2022, and following the maturity of the March 2022 gilt previously held by the Asset Purchase Facility (APF), the total stock of assets held in the APF was £867 billion, comprising £847 billion of UK government bond purchases and £20 billion of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases. 66: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Michael Saunders Silvana Tenreyro Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. 67: As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Dorothy Thompson was also present on 8 March, and Bradley Fried and Dorothy Thompson were present on 11 March, as observers for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in their roles as members of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 4 May will be published on 5 May 2022.

At its meeting ending on 4 May 2022, the MPC voted by a majority of 6-3 to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 1%. Those members in the minority preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.25%. Global inflationary pressures have intensified sharply following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This has led to a material deterioration in the outlook for world and UK growth. These developments have exacerbated greatly the combination of adverse supply shocks that the United Kingdom and other countries continue to face. Concerns about further supply chain disruption have also risen, both due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and to Covid-19 developments in China. UK GDP is estimated to have risen by 0.9% in 2022 Q1, stronger than expected in the February Monetary Policy Report. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8% in the three months to February, and is likely to fall slightly further in coming months, consistent with a continuing tightening in the labour market and with a margin of excess demand at present. Surveys of business activity have generally remained strong. There have, however, been signs from indicators of retail spending and consumer confidence that the squeeze on real disposable incomes is starting to weigh on the household sector. The level of GDP is expected to be broadly unchanged in Q2. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose to 7.0% in March, around 1 percentage point higher than expected in the February Report. The strength of inflation relative to the 2% target mainly reflects previous large increases in global energy and tradable goods prices, the latter of which is due to the shift in global demand towards durable goods and to supply chain disruptions. The Committee’s updated central projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying May Monetary Policy Report. The projections are conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rises to around 2½% by mid-2023, before falling to 2% at the end of the forecast period. Fiscal policy is assumed to evolve in line with announced Government policies. Wholesale energy prices are assumed to follow their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projections and remain constant beyond that, in contrast to futures curves, which are downward sloping over coming years. There are material risks around this assumption. In the May Report central projection, CPI inflation is expected to rise further over the remainder of the year, to just over 9% in 2022 Q2 and averaging slightly over 10% at its peak in 2022 Q4. The majority of that further increase reflects higher household energy prices following the large rise in the Ofgem price cap in April and projected additional large increase in October. The price cap mechanism means that it takes some time for increases in wholesale gas and electricity prices, and their respective futures curves, to be reflected in retail energy prices. Given the operation of the price cap, consumer price inflation is likely to peak later in the United Kingdom than in many other economies, and may therefore fall back later. The expected rise in CPI inflation also reflects higher food, core goods and services prices. Underlying nominal earnings growth has risen by more than projected in the February Report and is expected to strengthen in coming months, given the further tightening of the labour market and some upward pressure from higher price inflation. Companies generally expect to increase their selling prices strongly in the near term, following the sharp rises in their costs, with many reporting confidence that they will be able to rebuild at least some of their margins. Nonetheless, in the May Report central projection, UK GDP growth is expected to slow sharply over the first half of the forecast period. That predominantly reflects the significant adverse impact of the sharp rises in global energy and tradable goods prices on most UK households’ real incomes and many UK companies’ profit margins. Although the unemployment rate is likely to fall slightly further in the near term, it is expected to rise to 5½% in three years’ time given the sharp slowdown in demand growth. Excess supply builds to 2¼% by the end of the forecast period. With monetary policy acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2% target, upward pressure on CPI inflation is expected to dissipate over time. Global commodity prices are assumed to rise no further in the central projection, global bottlenecks ease over time, and the weakening in demand growth and building excess supply lead domestic inflationary pressures to subside. Conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate and the MPC’s current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation is projected to fall to a little above the 2% target in two years’ time, largely reflecting the waning influence of external factors, and to 1.3% in three years, well below the target and mainly reflecting weaker domestic pressures. The risks to the inflation projection are judged to be skewed to the upside at these points, given the risks of more persistent strength in nominal wage growth and domestic price setting than assumed. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is another such shock. In particular, should recent movements prove persistent as the central projections assume, the very elevated levels of global energy and tradable goods prices, of which the United Kingdom is a net importer, will necessarily weigh further on most UK households’ real incomes and many UK companies’ profit margins. This is something monetary policy is unable to prevent. The role of monetary policy is to ensure that, as this real economic adjustment occurs, it does so in a manner consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. Recent developments have exacerbated materially both the near-term peak in CPI inflation, and the prospective negative impact on activity and medium-term inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, given the current tightness of the labour market, continuing signs of robust domestic cost and price pressures, and the risk that those pressures will persist, the Committee voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points at this meeting. Based on their updated assessment of the economic outlook, most members of the Committee judge that some degree of further tightening in monetary policy may still be appropriate in the coming months. There are risks on both sides of that judgement and a range of views among these members on the balance of risks. The MPC will continue to review developments in the light of incoming data and their implications for medium-term inflation. The Committee reaffirms its preference in most circumstances to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. As Bank Rate is now being increased to 1%, and consistent with the MPC’s previous guidance, the Committee will consider beginning the process of selling UK government bonds held in the Asset Purchase Facility. The Committee reaffirms that the decision to commence sales will depend on economic circumstances including market conditions at the time, and that sales would be expected to be conducted in a gradual and predictable manner so as not to disrupt the functioning of financial markets. The Committee recognises the benefits of providing market participants with clarity on the framework for any potential sales programme. The Committee has therefore asked Bank staff to work on a strategy for UK government bond sales, and will provide an update at its August meeting. This will allow the Committee to make a decision at a subsequent meeting on whether to commence sales. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 4 May 2022 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the backdrop of its latest economic projections, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: The economic consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine had started to be felt globally. From already elevated levels, increases in the prices of energy and other commodities since the start of the war had put further upward pressure on producer and consumer price inflation, weighing on real incomes. Concerns around supply chain bottlenecks had also risen, owing both to the war in Ukraine and to Covid-19 (Covid) developments in China. These developments were consistent with a deterioration in the outlook for global growth. UK-weighted global GDP was expected to grow only slightly in 2022 Q2, materially slower than had been anticipated at the time of the February Monetary Policy Report. 3: European economies were expected to be particularly affected by the war in Ukraine given their dependence on energy imports. Euro-area GDP was expected to grow only a little in 2022 Q2, at a rate significantly lower than had been anticipated in the February Report, following growth of 0.2% in Q1 according to the preliminary flash release. In the first quarter, the economic impact of the Omicron variant had been somewhat less than had been anticipated in the February Report, and indicators suggested that services activity had continued to expand into the second quarter as Covid restrictions had eased. Nonetheless, the war in Ukraine had weighed on growth prospects, particularly in the manufacturing sector, with output PMIs declining in April. Forward-looking indicators of business expectations and consumer confidence had also weakened significantly since the invasion. The outlook for Central and Eastern European countries had worsened, and their currencies had depreciated relative to the US dollar since the MPC’s last meeting, partly reflecting the strength of their trade linkages with Russia. Ukraine’s economic output was expected to decline materially as a direct consequence of the war. The Russian economy was also expected to contract significantly this year. 4: According to the advance estimate, US GDP had contracted by 0.4% in 2022 Q1, driven primarily by a widening of the trade deficit and weak inventory investment. Although this was weaker than had been anticipated in the February Report, underlying demand, namely personal consumption and gross private fixed investment, had remained strong in the first quarter, and spending had continued to rotate back towards services from goods. As a net exporter of oil and with retail gas prices having not risen by as much in absolute terms as in Europe, the US economy was expected to be relatively less affected by developments in commodity prices, albeit not fully shielded, and GDP was expected to expand reasonably strongly in the second quarter. The US labour market had remained tight, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.6% in March, close to pre-Covid levels. Wage growth had continued to rise, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s measure. 5: China had been experiencing a significant outbreak of Covid cases, against an already challenging economic backdrop, including stresses in the property sector. The authorities had imposed lockdowns in a number of large cities, including Shanghai, in late March. As a result of these developments, China’s GDP was expected to grow more slowly in 2022 Q2 than had been anticipated in the February Report, by 0.8%. This would also be weaker than in Q1, when GDP had grown by 1.3%. Consistent with the Chinese authorities’ approach to supporting manufacturing during Covid outbreaks, for example through closed-loop production systems in which workers remained on factory sites, industrial production growth had fallen by less than retail sales growth in March. Some ports in affected cities had experienced congestion and there had been widespread reports of delays to road freight, adding to global supply chain pressures. Although delays had started to ease, further disruptions were possible over the coming months. 6: Supply chain constraints had also arisen due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, intensifying global cost pressures. Russia and Ukraine were major producers of many inputs, ranging from metals and food to fertilisers, as well as oil and natural gas. The war had led to broad increases in commodity prices, although some had fallen back from their peaks over recent weeks. The spot price of Brent crude oil had increased by around 25% to $106 per barrel since the February Report. 7: European gas prices had risen sharply following the invasion, before moderating. Russia’s decision to cease gas flows to Poland and Bulgaria in late April had led to a short-lived increase in the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) spot price, which now stood at around €100 per MWh, broadly the same level as at the MPC’s March meeting and around 20% higher than at the time of the February Report. The TTF futures curve remained at around this level for just under a year before declining notably. A wedge had opened up between the TTF and UK spot gas prices, with UK contracts trading at a lower level of around €65 per MWh, or 160 pence per therm. This was due to large liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments to the United Kingdom, alongside a rebound in output from Norwegian gas fields and seasonally warmer weather. This wedge persisted in the futures curve for about six months, at which point the UK futures price rose to the TTF futures price as LNG shipments to the UK were expected to be more in line with capacity to re-export to the European Union. 8: Over recent weeks, metals prices had fallen to levels a little above those at the time of the February Report in aggregate, although the prices of some metals such as nickel and zinc had remained elevated. Food prices, including wheat and corn, had remained substantially higher than at the time of the February Report. 9: Against this backdrop of strong commodity prices, global consumer price inflation had continued to rise. In the euro area, annual HICP inflation had increased to 7.5% in April, with core inflation at 3.5%. In the United States, annual CPI inflation had risen to 8.5% in March, with core inflation at 6.5%, while headline PCE inflation had increased to 6.6%. Much of the increase in US CPI inflation had been due to higher contributions from energy prices, but core goods and services components had continued to make the largest contributions to the inflation rate. In the euro area, energy prices had been the main contributor to inflation, although core inflation had risen sharply in April. Measures of inflation expectations had generally increased in advanced economies, in particular at shorter horizons. 10: The Committee discussed the risks around the global inflation outlook, and the implications for growth. There was an upside risk to the future path for energy prices, particularly gas prices, for example if flows of Russian gas to large euro-area countries slowed significantly. Under such a scenario, European gas prices would be likely to increase sharply and gas quantities could be rationed going into next winter as EU gas stocks might run low. There was also an upside risk to inflation from further price pressures related to global supply chain disruptions. Additional constraints affecting transportation capacity, inputs to industrial processes and agricultural production were possible, both owing to the war in Ukraine and if there were further severe Covid outbreaks in China. Set against the backdrop of continuing strong US consumer demand, this could generate further increases in core goods prices, although lower demand from China could reduce commodity prices at the margin. Finally, there was a risk that tight labour markets and strong wage growth, coupled with higher inflation expectations, could lead to further inflationary pressures in advanced economies. Additional price pressures could lead to a further deterioration in the global growth outlook as real incomes were squeezed, reducing consumer spending and exacerbating the policy challenges facing central banks around the world. Monetary and financial conditions 11: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, advanced-economy government bond yields had risen significantly and by more in the United States and in the euro area than in the United Kingdom. Ten-year yields had increased by around 80 basis points in the United States, 65 basis points in the euro area and 35 basis points in the United Kingdom. 12: The near-term path for market-implied policy rates in the United States had risen significantly since the MPC’s previous meeting. At its March meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee had increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 0.25-0.50% and had given an indication that the Committee was well placed to begin the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as early as May and at a quicker pace than during the 2017-19 episode of balance sheet reduction. The market-implied policy rate in the United States reached 2.8% by end-2022 and peaked at around 3.4% in 2023. In the euro area, the near-term market-implied path for policy rates had also risen since the MPC’s previous meeting. At its meeting on 14 April, the ECB Governing Council had left its key policy interest rates unchanged and had noted that recent data had reinforced its expectation that net asset purchases should be concluded in the third quarter of 2022. 13: In the United Kingdom, market pricing was consistent with an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points, to 1% at this MPC meeting, and market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate had risen further out. The May Monetary Policy Report was conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate, based on the 15-working day average to 26 April, that rose to around 2% by end-2022, peaked at 2.6% in 2023 and then fell back to around 2% in three years’ time. The results of the Bank of England’s Market Participants Survey had indicated broadly similar expectations for Bank Rate in the near term, with almost all respondents expecting a 0.25 percentage point increase at this meeting. Respondents expected a much lower central path for Bank Rate than the market-implied path further ahead, albeit a significant number of respondents viewed the balance of risks around that path as being skewed to the upside rather than to the downside over the next two years, reconciling at least in part the difference with market-implied expectations. 14: Short-term financial market inflation compensation measures in the United Kingdom had increased since the MPC’s previous meeting, in part reflecting the continued impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on gas and other energy prices. At the same time, medium-term inflation compensation measures in the United Kingdom had fallen modestly, but they had remained above their levels at the time of the February Report and above their average levels of the past decade. Intelligence gathered from market contacts, suggested that higher inflation expectations and greater perceived upside risks to inflation might have in part accounted for these above-average levels of medium-term inflation compensation measures, alongside other factors. 15: The US dollar effective exchange rate had appreciated by around 2% since the MPC’s March meeting, as interest rate differentials had widened. The sterling effective exchange rate had depreciated by around 1%, while the euro effective exchange rate had remained broadly unchanged. 16: US and euro-area equity prices had been broadly unchanged since the MPC’s previous meeting. The FTSE All-Share index had increased to levels seen prior to the invasion of Ukraine, but the UK-focussed FTSE index, which had been less supported by the rise in energy prices, had remained below levels seen prior to the invasion. There had been less adjustment in the corporate bond market. 17: UK bank lending rates on mortgages with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at or below 75% had risen further since the MPC’s previous meeting. This was broadly consistent with a lagged response to the increases in risk-free rates since the autumn of 2021. Lending rates on higher LTV mortgages and sight deposit rates had also started to increase. The further increases in risk-free rates that had occurred since the March MPC meeting would be expected to feed through to mortgage rates in due course. Interest rates on unsecured household borrowing, such as credit cards and personal loans had, as usual, been less sensitive to changes in reference rates. Demand and output 18: Starting with the most immediate quarter with a complete dataset, UK real GDP growth in 2021 Q4 had been revised up slightly, from 1.0% to 1.3%, with the level of GDP estimated to have been almost identical to that in 2019 Q4 prior to the pandemic. Within the expenditure components, household consumption had risen by 0.5% on the quarter and the saving ratio had fallen to 6.5%, its lowest level since the onset of the pandemic though still higher than during the pre-Covid period. Business investment had increased by 1.0% in Q4, leaving it around 8½% below its pre-pandemic level. Government spending had risen by 1.2%, to almost 9% above its pre-Covid level. 19: Turning to the latest available monthly data, GDP had increased by 0.1% in February, following 0.8% growth in January. The output of consumer-facing services had risen strongly in February, particularly in the accommodation and foods, and arts and recreation sectors, as the economic impact of the Omicron variant had unwound. Government services output had fallen back, as spending on NHS Test and Trace and the vaccination programme had declined. Manufacturing and construction output had fallen slightly on the month. 20: For the first quarter as a whole, Bank staff now expected GDP growth of 0.9%, stronger than the flat quarterly outturn that had been incorporated in the February Monetary Policy Report projection. That upward revision largely reflected higher-than-expected market-sector output. 21: There had been increasing signs that the squeeze on real disposable incomes was starting to weigh on the household sector. Retail sales volumes had fallen by 1.4% in March, following a 0.5% decline in February, with weakness in fuel, food store and non-store retailing. Nominal retail sales values had remained broadly stable, such that weaker sales volumes had been the counterpart to recent further increases in the sales deflator. GfK consumer confidence had declined sharply in April, to close to the previous low point for the series recorded in mid-2008. All five backward and forward looking sub-balances feeding into the headline confidence indicator had fallen on the month. Indicators of house prices and housing activity had remained robust, however. 22: Although some activity indicators from business surveys had weakened, they had remained notably stronger than their household survey counterparts. The S&P Global/CIPS flash composite output index had fallen from 60.9 in March to 57.6 in April, but had remained above its long-run average level. The composite new orders and output expectations series had fallen to around their long-run averages. According to contacts of the Bank’s Agents, output was growing at a solid pace overall, with business services reporting strong growth. But growth had continued to be held back by shortages of labour and goods, with the latter worsening and becoming more widespread since the invasion of Ukraine and the increase in Covid-related restrictions in China. Investment intentions reported to the Agents had remained strong despite increasing uncertainty, although current investment spending was being held back by cost pressures and shortages of materials, goods and labour. Expected sales growth over the year between 2021 Q4 and 2022 Q4 had remained strong in the April Decision Maker Panel results. 23: In the May Report central projection, GDP was expected to increase by 0.1% in 2022 Q2, as the real income squeeze weighed on household spending and there were some adverse effects from the renewed disruption of supply chains. Covid-related government spending was also projected to decline further. The timing of the additional Platinum Jubilee Bank Holiday was expected to reduce growth temporarily by a ¼ percentage point, with an equivalent boost expected in 2022 Q3. As a result, excluding the temporary impact of the extra Bank Holiday, market-sector output was projected to grow in Q2, but at only about half of the pace expected in the first quarter. 24: The Committee discussed the risks around the near-term outlook for GDP. In the May Report central projections, real consumer spending was projected to rise only slightly in 2022 Q2 and during H2, while real household disposable income was expected to decline materially. That reflected a judgement that the household saving ratio would fall to around 5% in Q2 and to 3½% by the end of the year, around 1 percentage point below its 2019 average. There were downside risks to that consumption profile from reduced-form models and from a mechanical pre-Covid mapping of recent consumer confidence declines to spending growth. Set against that, it was possible that the saving ratio could fall back even further in the near term, or remain lower for longer, than had been projected. Many respondents to the latest Bank/NMG household survey had stated that they would save less or use existing savings if faced with a hypothetical increase in inflation. And recent strength in business-to-business services, manufacturing and construction output could persist for longer than was assumed in the central projection, consistent to some extent with the relative strength in business survey indicators of output. 25: The Chancellor of the Exchequer had presented the Spring Statement to Parliament on 23 March. In addition to the measures in the Energy Bills Rebate package that had been announced in February, the Spring Statement had included an immediate twelve-month reduction in fuel duty. There had also been an announcement of an increase in the annual National Insurance Primary Threshold and the Lower Profits Limit from July 2022 to align with the income tax personal allowance, and a reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19% from April 2024. Taken together, Bank staff estimated that these measures were likely to boost GDP by around ½% over coming years. Supply, costs and prices 26: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen to 3.8% in the three months to February, consistent with an ongoing tightening in the labour market. The number of inactive people who reported wanting a job had also continued to be historically low. Inactivity had increased in aggregate and LFS employment had been broadly flat in recent months. In contrast, growth in HMRC employee payrolls and survey indicators of employment had remained strong. 27: The Committee discussed the risks to the outlook for labour market activity. The labour market had again been tighter than expected. The Bank’s Agents were reporting that firms’ employment intentions had remained robust, despite increased uncertainty around the broader economic outlook, but that the recent rate of hiring had been hindered by higher than usual staff turnover and recruitment difficulties. The number of vacancies had remained elevated, and survey measures of firms’ employment intentions and households’ sense of their own job security had also continued to be resilient. Nevertheless, the labour market had lagged activity around previous turning points in the economic cycle, and the prospective weakening in output was likely to weigh on labour demand in coming quarters. Consistent with this, in the May Monetary Policy Report forecast, the unemployment rate was projected to fall further in 2022 Q2, before stabilising in the second half of the year and increasing in 2023. 28: Whole-economy Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth had increased to 5.4% in the three months to February on a year earlier, more than 1 percentage point above the February Report forecast, reflecting strength in both regular pay and bonuses. Bank staff estimated that underlying private-sector regular pay growth had remained at around 4 to 4½%, once adjusting for the mechanical effects of changes in the composition of the workforce and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. The median pay settlement recorded in the Bank staff’s database had risen in the first few months of this year, broadly consistent with the Agents’ February pay survey. More recently, some of the Agents’ contacts had begun to consider further increases in pay settlements, or one-off bonuses, during the course of the year to retain staff, especially where there was strong demand for particular skills. Underlying pay growth was expected to increase over the remainder of the year, and by more than had been projected in the February Report, consistent with a tight labour market alongside rising inflation. 29: Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 7.0% in March, around 1 percentage point above the February Report forecast. The bulk of the upside news had been split evenly across energy and core goods prices. Taken together, energy and core goods components had also accounted for around four-fifths of the overshoot of CPI inflation relative to the 2% target, with the remainder spread across food and services components. Core goods inflation had been somewhat weaker in the euro area than in the United Kingdom and the United States. 30: CPI inflation was expected to rise to around 9% in April, and to increase further in subsequent months, averaging slightly over 10% at its peak in 2022 Q4. 31: The build up to and subsequent Russian invasion of Ukraine had pushed up commodity prices further. Household gas and electricity prices were due to contribute an additional 1½ percentage points to CPI inflation in April as the new energy price caps announced by Ofgem took effect. Further increases in wholesale prices, which had remained elevated even as spot prices had moderated, were likely to result in higher retail energy price caps when they were next reset in October. Around half of the six-month observation window for determining those price caps had now been completed. If sustained, higher gas and electricity futures prices would mean that the price caps could be around 40% higher, adding a further 1½ percentage points to CPI inflation from October. In addition, recent increases in wholesale oil and food commodity prices were being passed through to households. 32: Core CPI inflation, excluding food, beverages, tobacco and energy, was also expected to increase from its rate of 5.7% in March. Survey indicators of cost and price pressures had remained at historically elevated levels, and recent inflation outturns had tended to be above rates implied by their past relationships with those indicators. A special survey on pricing and profit margins conducted by the Bank’s Agents suggested that firms expected significantly more upwards pressure on prices over the next twelve months than the previous twelve months. Higher labour costs, utilities prices, and the costs of shipping and raw materials were frequently cited as factors pushing up on inflation over the next year. Around half of survey respondents considered that it was easier than normal to pass these cost increases through to prices. Close to 40% of companies had described their margins as unsustainably low at present, but three-fifths of those firms had anticipated rebuilding their margins to sustainable levels over the next twelve months. 33: Measures of businesses’ inflation expectations had risen further since the MPC’s previous meeting. Respondents to the Decision Maker Panel had increased their expectations for their own price increases over the next twelve months to 6.2% on average in April, and more than three quarters of those responding to the 2022 Q1 Deloitte CFO Survey had anticipated CPI inflation being above 2½% in two years’ time. The Citi/YouGov household measures of expectations over the next year and next five-to-ten years had edged down in April, but had remained historically elevated. Professional forecasters had continued to expect inflation to be close to the 2% target in the medium term. The immediate policy decision 34: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 35: The Committee reviewed recent developments against the backdrop of its updated central projections for activity and inflation as set out in the accompanying May Monetary Policy Report. The projections were conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rose to around 2½% by mid-2023, before falling to 2% at the end of the forecast period. Fiscal policy was assumed to evolve in line with announced Government policies. Wholesale energy prices were assumed to follow their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projections and remain constant beyond that, in contrast to futures curves, which were downward sloping over coming years. There were material risks around this assumption. 36: Global inflationary pressures had intensified sharply following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This had led to a material deterioration in the outlook for world growth. Global GDP was expected to grow only slightly in 2022 Q2. Concerns about further supply chain disruption had risen, both due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and to Covid-19 developments in China. 37: Market pricing was consistent with an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points, to 1% at this MPC meeting, and market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate had risen further out. The Bank of England’s Market Participants Survey indicated broadly similar expectations for Bank Rate in the near term, although respondents expected a much lower central path for Bank Rate than the market-implied path further ahead. 38: The Chancellor of the Exchequer had presented the Spring Statement to Parliament on 23 March. Taken together with the Energy Bills Rebate package that had been announced in February, Bank staff estimated that the Spring Statement measures were likely to boost GDP by around ½% over coming years. 39: UK GDP was estimated to have risen by 0.9% in 2022 Q1, stronger than had been expected in the February Report. That upward revision largely reflected higher-than-expected market-sector output. 40: The unemployment rate had fallen to 3.8% in the three months to February, and was likely to fall slightly further in coming months, consistent with a continuing tightening in the labour market and with a margin of excess demand at present. Inactivity had increased, however, and LFS employment had been broadly flat in recent months. In contrast, growth in HMRC employee payrolls and survey indicators of employment had remained strong. Firms had continued to report significant recruitment difficulties and elevated levels of vacancies, and most surveys suggested above-average levels of capacity utilisation. 41: Surveys of business activity had generally remained strong. There had, however, been signs from indicators of retail spending and consumer confidence that the squeeze on real disposable incomes was starting to weigh on the household sector. The level of GDP was expected to be broadly unchanged in 2022 Q2. The timing of the additional Platinum Jubilee Bank Holiday was expected to reduce growth temporarily by a ¼ percentage point, with an equivalent boost expected in Q3. Excluding the temporary impact of the extra Bank Holiday, market-sector output was projected to grow in Q2, but at only about half of the pace expected in the first quarter. 42: In the May Report central projection, UK GDP growth was expected to slow sharply over the first half of the forecast period. That predominantly reflected the significant adverse impact of the sharp rises in global energy and tradable goods prices on most UK households’ real incomes and many UK companies’ profit margins. Total real household disposable income was projected to fall by 1¾% in 2022, which was a greater fall than in the February projection. Four-quarter consumption growth was expected to slow materially over the first half of the forecast period. However, it was expected to slow by much less than income growth and was positive throughout the projection. The outlook for aggregate consumption would depend on a range of factors including the distribution of the squeeze on incomes across households, and the extent to which they were willing and able to draw on accumulated savings. Overall, four-quarter GDP growth was expected to be broadly flat in 2023. 43: Although the unemployment rate was likely to fall slightly further in the near term, it was expected to rise to 5½% in three years’ time given the sharp slowdown in demand growth. The Committee had also revised down its projection for labour force participation following the fall during the pandemic. In the May Report central projection, excess supply in the economy was expected to build to 2¼% by the end of the forecast period. 44: Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 7.0% in March, around 1 percentage point higher than had been expected in the February Report. The strength of inflation relative to the MPC’s 2% target mainly reflected previous large increases in global energy and tradable goods prices, the latter of which was due to the shift in global demand towards durable goods and to supply chain disruptions. There had also been some increase in the inflation rates of more domestically supplied services. 45: In the May Report central projection, CPI inflation was expected to rise further over the remainder of the year, to just over 9% in 2022 Q2 and averaging slightly over 10% at its peak in 2022 Q4. The majority of that further increase reflected higher household energy prices following the large rise in the Ofgem price cap in April and projected additional large increase in October. The price cap mechanism meant that it took some time for increases in wholesale gas and electricity prices, and their respective futures curves, to be reflected in retail energy prices. Given the operation of the price cap, consumer price inflation was likely to peak later in the United Kingdom than in many other economies, and might therefore fall back later. The expected rise in CPI inflation also reflected higher food, core goods and services prices. 46: The Bank staff’s measure of underlying nominal earnings growth had risen by more than had been projected in the February Report and was expected to strengthen in coming months, given the further tightening of the labour market and some upward pressure from higher price inflation. The median pay settlement recorded in the Bank staff’s database had risen, broadly consistent with the Agents’ February pay survey. More recently, some of the Agents’ contacts had begun to consider further increases in pay settlements, or one-off bonuses, during the course of the year. Companies generally expected to increase their selling prices strongly in the near term, following the sharp rises in their costs, with many reporting confidence that they would be able to rebuild at least some of their margins. 47: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, UK short-term financial market inflation compensation measures had continued to increase, as had measures of businesses’ short to medium-term inflation expectations. Longer-term inflation expectations implied by financial markets and in household surveys had fallen modestly but remained elevated by historic norms. There had been limited news in indicators of professional forecasters’ expectations. The Committee would continue to monitor measures of inflation expectations very closely. 48: With monetary policy acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target, upward pressure on CPI inflation was expected to dissipate over time. Global commodity prices were assumed to rise no further in the central projection, global bottlenecks were expected to ease over time, and the weakening in demand growth and building excess supply led domestic inflationary pressures to subside. 49: Conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate and the MPC’s current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation was projected to fall to a little above the 2% target in two years’ time, largely reflecting the waning influence of external factors, and to 1.3% in three years, well below the target and mainly reflecting weaker domestic pressures. The risks to the inflation projection were judged to be skewed to the upside at these points, given the risks of more persistent strength in nominal wage growth and domestic price setting than had been assumed. In projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 1%, CPI inflation was expected to be 2.9% and 2.2% in two and three years’ time respectively. 50: There were downside risks to the assumed paths for energy and other commodity prices if prices fell back to the levels implied by futures curves. In the case of energy prices, the level of GDP would be nearly 1% higher by the end of the forecast period and excess supply and unemployment around ¾ percentage points lower than the central forecast in the May Report. CPI inflation would fall back towards the target more rapidly than in the central projection and would be around ½ and over 1 percentage points below the target in two and three years’ time respectively. 51: The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 52: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy had recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was another such shock. In particular, should recent movements prove persistent as the central projections assumed, the very elevated levels of global energy and tradable goods prices, of which the United Kingdom was a net importer, would necessarily weigh further on most UK households’ real incomes and many UK companies’ profit margins. This was something monetary policy was unable to prevent. The role of monetary policy was to ensure that, as this real economic adjustment occurred, it did so in a manner consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. 53: Recent developments had exacerbated materially both the near-term peak in CPI inflation, and the prospective negative impact on activity and medium-term inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, given the current tightness of the labour market, continuing signs of robust domestic cost and price pressures, and the risk that those pressures would persist, all members of the Committee judged that an increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. 54: Different members placed different weights on the arguments for whether to increase Bank Rate at this meeting and if so by 0.25 or 0.5 percentage points. Momentum in labour market activity had continued to be both strong and stronger than had been expected. Strength in the labour market had so far been accompanied by a notable resilience in business relative to consumer confidence. While there were signs of weakness in household spending now that the real income squeeze was beginning to bite, the stronger than forecast domestic inflationary pressures since the February Report justified a further increase in Bank Rate. Underlying wage growth had continued to strengthen and, at a time of already high headline inflation, there was the potential for some further second-round effects in domestic wage and price setting. A key question was whether some self-sustaining momentum in domestically generated inflation would remain even as slack in the economy was expected to open up. The greater the delay between the real income squeeze leading to weakness in aggregate demand and to a turn-around in the labour market, the more risk there was that higher inflation expectations would become embedded in the economy. 55: Six members of the Committee judged that a further 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate to 1% was warranted at this meeting. The May Report projections implied that some tightening in monetary policy was required to bring inflation back to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. But, conditioned on the market path for Bank Rate, the endpoint of the forecast was characterised by a large margin of excess supply and CPI inflation well below target, although the medium-term outlook was particularly uncertain currently. 56: Three members preferred a 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate at this meeting. These members put more weight on continued strength in demand, yielding risks that capacity pressures, especially in the labour market, would be greater over the forecast period than in the May Report projections. These members also judged that monetary policy should lean strongly against risks that recent trends in pay growth, firms’ pricing strategies and inflation expectations in the economy more widely would become more firmly embedded. Faster policy tightening now would help to bring inflation back to the target sustainably in the medium term, and reduce risks of a more extended and costly tightening cycle later. 57: Based on their updated assessment of the economic outlook, most members of the Committee judged that some degree of further tightening in monetary policy might still be appropriate in the coming months. There were risks on both sides of that judgement and a range of views among these members on the balance of risks. 58: Some members of the Committee judged that the risks around activity and inflation over the policy horizon were more evenly balanced and that such guidance was not appropriate at this juncture. 59: The MPC would continue to review developments in the light of incoming data and their implications for medium-term inflation. 60: At its February 2022 meeting, consistent with the guidance set out in the August 2021 Report, and given that financial markets were functioning normally, the Committee had agreed to cease to reinvest any future maturities falling due from its stock of UK government bond purchases. This had reflected the MPC’s intention to reduce its holdings of government bonds in a gradual and predictable manner. The MPC had also reaffirmed that it would consider beginning the process of selling UK government bonds only once Bank Rate had risen to at least 1%, and depending on economic circumstances at the time. 61: At this MPC meeting, the Committee reaffirmed its preference in most circumstances to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. As Bank Rate was now being increased to 1%, and consistent with the MPC’s previous guidance, the Committee would consider beginning the process of selling UK government bonds held in the Asset Purchase Facility. The Committee reaffirmed that the decision to commence sales would depend on economic circumstances including market conditions at the time, and that sales would be expected to be conducted in a gradual and predictable manner so as not to disrupt the functioning of financial markets. The Committee recognised the benefits of providing market participants with clarity on the framework for any potential sales programme. The Committee had therefore asked Bank staff to work on a strategy for UK government bond sales, and would provide an update at its August meeting. This would allow the Committee to make a decision at a subsequent meeting on whether to commence sales. 62: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.25 percentage points, to 1%. 63: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members (Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann and Michael Saunders) voted against the proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.25%. Operational considerations 64: As of 4 May 2022, the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) was £867 billion, comprising £847 billion of UK government bond purchases and £19.6 billion of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases. 65: At the February 2022 MPC meeting, the Committee had agreed that the Bank of England should cease to reinvest any maturities falling due from its stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, and that it should initiate a programme of corporate bond sales to be completed no earlier than towards the end of 2023 that should unwind fully the stock of corporate bond purchases. The Committee had also asked Bank staff to design a programme of corporate bond sales, designed so as not to disrupt the functioning of the sterling investment-grade corporate bond market. 66: Consistent with that previous guidance, the Committee had been briefed at this MPC meeting on the Bank of England’s plans to commence corporate bond sales in September 2022, and for any corporate bonds held in the portfolio maturing on or before 5 April 2024 to be allowed to mature. Further details were being provided in the high-level Market Notice accompanying these minutes, with a full operational Market Notice to be published at least a month prior to the start of the sales programme. The publication of further information on this programme of corporate bond sales should not be taken as a signal regarding the design or timing of any potential future UK government bond sales programme. 67: As had been agreed in the exchange of letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in February 2022, as the size of APF holdings declined, the authorised maximum size of the APF should be adjusted to reflect the size of the portfolio every six months. In line with that earlier agreement, and as set out in a further exchange of letters that would be released alongside these minutes, the authorised maximum size of the APF could now be reduced to align with the size of the current holdings. This would be reviewed and confirmed between the Governor and Chancellor again in October. 68: As noted in the Governor’s letter to the Chancellor in February 2022, were gilt sales judged to be appropriate in the future, these would be conducted in a predictable manner over a period of time so as not to disrupt the functioning of financial markets. The Bank would liaise with the UK Debt Management Office (DMO) in order to minimise interference with the DMO's own issuance programme and would consider the views of market participants as to how best to minimise disruption in asset markets. 69: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Michael Saunders Silvana Tenreyro James Benford was present as the Treasury representative on 27 April and Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative on 29 April and 4 May. 70: As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Dido Harding was also present on 27 April and 29 April, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in her role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 15 June will be published on 16 June 2022.

Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 15 June 2022 ( PDF 0.2MB) PDF Close dialog Published on 16 June 2022 Monetary Policy Summary, June 2022 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 15 June 2022, the MPC voted by a majority of 6-3 to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 1.25%. Those members in the minority preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.5%. In the MPC’s central projections in the May Monetary Policy Report, UK GDP growth was expected to slow sharply over the first half of the forecast period and, although the labour market was expected to tighten slightly further in the near term, the unemployment rate was projected to rise to 5½% in three years’ time. CPI inflation was expected to average slightly over 10% at its peak in 2022 Q4. Conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate at that time and the MPC’s forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation was projected to fall to a little above the 2% target in two years’ time, largely reflecting the waning influence of external factors, and to be well below the target in three years, mainly reflecting weaker domestic pressures. The risks to the inflation projection were judged to be skewed to the upside at these points. There has been relatively little news in global and domestic economic data since the May Report, although there have been significant movements in financial markets. UK-weighted global growth in 2022 Q2 appears to be broadly in line with expectations. Global inflationary pressures have remained elevated and oil prices have risen further. Equity markets have ended the period lower, while short and longer-term government bond yields have continued to rise. UK GDP was weaker than expected in April, partly reflecting a further decline in Test and Trace activity. Bank staff now expect GDP to fall by 0.3% in the second quarter as a whole, weaker than anticipated at the time of the May Report. Consumer confidence has fallen further, but other indicators of household spending appear to have held up. Some indicators of business sentiment have weakened, although they have so far remained more resilient than indicators of consumer confidence and consistent with positive underlying GDP growth. In the three months to April, the unemployment rate was 3.8% and employment grew by 0.5%. The inactivity rate has declined a little over recent months but is still higher than immediately before the pandemic. Recruitment difficulties have remained elevated and labour demand has remained strong. Underlying nominal earnings growth has also remained strong, and the Bank’s Agents report that bonus payments have been used to address recruitment and retention difficulties. All of these indicators remain consistent with a tight labour market. Initial Bank staff analysis of the Government’s recent Cost of Living Support package suggests that, all else equal, it could boost GDP by around 0.3% and raise CPI inflation by 0.1 percentage points in the first year, with some upside risks around these estimates given the targeted and front-loaded nature of some of the measures. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 7.0% in March to 9.0% in April, close to expectations at the time of the May Report, and triggering the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that is being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Inflation’s overshoot of the 2% target mainly reflects previous large increases in global energy and other tradable goods prices. The former has been greatly exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, which has also raised significantly the wholesale price of many agricultural commodities. The latter mainly reflects the impact of the pandemic, which shifted demand towards goods but also impaired and disrupted supply chains. However, not all of the excess inflation can be attributed to global events. There has also been a role for interactions with domestic factors, including the tight labour market and the pricing strategies of firms. Consumer services price inflation, which is more influenced by domestic costs than goods price inflation, has strengthened in recent months. In addition, core consumer goods price inflation is higher in the United Kingdom than in the euro area and in the United States. CPI inflation is expected to be over 9% during the next few months and to rise to slightly above 11% in October. The increase in October reflects higher projected household energy prices following a prospective additional large increase in the Ofgem price cap. In the MPC’s latest forecasts in May, upward pressure on CPI inflation was expected to dissipate over time. In the main, this reflected the stabilisation of the prices of commodities, albeit at elevated levels, and other tradable goods. It also reflected the combined impact of weaker real incomes and tighter monetary policy on domestic demand. Monetary policy is also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2% target. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Monetary policy will ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks occurs, CPI inflation will return to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. In view of continuing signs of robust cost and price pressures, including the current tightness of the labour market, and the risk that those pressures become more persistent, the Committee voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 1.25%, at this meeting. The MPC will take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. The scale, pace and timing of any further increases in Bank Rate will reflect the Committee’s assessment of the economic outlook and inflationary pressures. The Committee will be particularly alert to indications of more persistent inflationary pressures, and will if necessary act forcefully in response. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 15 June 2022 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: UK-weighted global growth in 2022 Q2 appeared to be broadly in line with expectations at the time of the May Monetary Policy Report. Global inflationary pressures had remained elevated. 3: GDP growth rates in the euro area and in the United States were likely to be marginally stronger in 2022 Q2 than in the May Report, with quarterly rates of 0.3% and 0.8% now expected respectively. Business and particularly consumer confidence had fallen back in both regions since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, although some sentiment indicators had shown signs of stabilising in the euro area in May. The euro-area unemployment rate had remained unchanged at a record low of 6.8% in April, while the US unemployment rate had held steady at 3.6% in May, close to pre-pandemic levels. 4: China had experienced Covid-19 (Covid) outbreaks in major cities over recent months, and the authorities had imposed strict regional lockdowns to control the spread of the virus. In part reflecting those developments, Chinese activity data had been weaker in April than had been anticipated at the time of the May Report, and Bank staff now expected the level of GDP to be broadly flat in 2022 Q2 compared with the 0.8% quarterly growth that had been incorporated in the May Report. The slowdown had continued to be most marked in indicators of consumption. Industrial production had also seen a decline, albeit somewhat smaller relative to the strictness of the lockdowns, as some companies had continued to operate via so-called closed-loop production systems. Continued weakness in the property sector had weighed on fixed investment. Activity was expected to recover as some Covid restrictions had started to be lifted more recently. PMI indicators in May had shown a slowing in the rate of contraction, and indicators of supply constraints had started to ease somewhat, with Shanghai’s major port operating closer to capacity. 5: Developments in commodity prices had been mixed since the MPC’s previous meeting. The spot price of Brent crude oil had increased by around 15% to $120 per barrel. European gas prices had ended the period little changed, with the Dutch Title Transfer Facility spot price, a measure of prices in the continental wholesale market, at around €100 per MWh. Agricultural commodity and metals prices had been volatile, and they were now down slightly since the MPC’s previous meeting though still at elevated levels. 6: Euro-area annual HICP inflation had increased to 8.1% in May according to the flash release, with core inflation at 3.8%, both of which had been stronger than market expectations. US annual CPI inflation had rebounded to 8.6% in May, also above market expectations, while core inflation had fallen slightly to 6.0%. The headline US CPI figure was consistent with annual PCE inflation remaining stable at 6.3%. Indicators of wage growth had stabilised at elevated levels over recent months in the United States and risen in the euro area. Monetary and financial conditions 7: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, government bond yields and risky asset prices had been volatile in major advanced economies. Ten-year government bond yields had risen by around 40, 55 and 75 basis points in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany respectively. Equity indices in the major advanced economies had fallen since the MPC’s previous meeting, with large declines in the S&P 500 and the Euro Stoxx 50. Spreads on advanced economy corporate bonds had also widened over recent days. 8: The near-term path for market-implied policy rates in the United States and in the euro area had risen significantly since the MPC’s previous meeting, reaching around 3.6% and 1.3% respectively by end-2022. At its meeting on 9 June, the ECB Governing Council had decided to end net asset purchases under its asset purchase programme as of 1 July 2022 and had left its key policy interest rates unchanged. As set out in the accompanying statement, the Governing Council had also concluded that the conditions, according to its forward guidance, for starting to raise the key ECB interest rates had been satisfied. Therefore, the Governing Council was intending to raise these rates by 0.25% at its July monetary policy meeting. Looking further ahead, the Governing Council was expecting to raise them again in September. The calibration of this rate increase would depend on the updated medium-term inflation outlook and, if the medium-term inflation outlook persisted or deteriorated, the Governing Council had indicated that a larger increment would be appropriate. 9: In the United Kingdom, market pricing indicated an expectation of an increase of 0.25 percentage points in Bank Rate, to 1.25%, at this MPC meeting. The market-implied path for Bank Rate had risen materially since the MPC’s previous meeting, reaching around 2.9% by end-2022 and peaking at 3.3% in 2023. This path continued to be higher than the expectations for Bank Rate of respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey, perhaps in part reflecting upside risks to the inflation outlook domestically and internationally. 10: The sterling effective exchange rate had depreciated by around 2½% since the previous MPC meeting and by almost 4% compared to the 15-day moving average on which the May Monetary Policy Report projections had been conditioned. Sterling had been particularly weak against the US dollar. According to market participants, the recent movements had in part reflected the rising yield differential between shorter-term government bond yields in the United States compared to those in the United Kingdom, and perceptions of the UK growth outlook. 11: Lending rates for new mortgages in the United Kingdom had increased further in May, reflecting a continuing response to the increases in Bank Rate and risk-free market rates that had been observed since the autumn of 2021. Lending rates on mortgages with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at or below 75% had risen by more than those at higher LTV ratios, such that the spread between the two had narrowed to below pre-pandemic levels. Interest rates on unsecured borrowing had also increased slightly overall. As usual, however, households’ unsecured lending rates had continued to be less sensitive to changes in risk-free rates. Rates on new lending to businesses were higher in April than in December 2021, reflecting the increases in Bank Rate. 12: Taking together all of the evidence so far, the pass-through of the increases in risk-free rates to mortgage rates since the autumn of 2021 had been greater than in 2017-18 and much closer to the full pass-through that was seen prior to the financial crisis when interest rates had been further away from the lower bound. Interest rates on instant-access deposits had also increased since last autumn, though by much less than for mortgage lending. The further increases in risk-free rates that had occurred since the May MPC meeting would be expected to feed through to lending and deposit rates in due course. Demand and output 13: According to the ONS’s first quarterly estimate, UK GDP had increased by 0.8% in 2022 Q1, slightly below the expectations incorporated into the May Monetary Policy Report projection. Within the expenditure components, household consumption had risen by 0.4% on the quarter and business investment, which was often subject to substantial revision, had fallen by 0.5%. Total government expenditure had risen by 1.5%. 14: Monthly GDP had fallen by 0.1% in March and by 0.3% in April, the latter weaker than expectations. Government services output had fallen significantly in April, as NHS Test and Trace activity had continued to decline. Manufacturing output had also fallen, below expectations at the time of the May Report. Output in consumer-facing services had risen by 2.2% in April, broadly in line with expectations. 15: Bank staff now expected GDP to fall by 0.3% in 2022 Q2, below the May Report projection of 0.1% growth. The downside news had reflected a larger than expected impact from the scaling back of Test and Trace activity in April, alongside weaker than expected market sector output growth. Relative to 2022 Q1, the slowing in growth was still expected primarily to reflect temporary factors such as the additional bank holiday for the Platinum Jubilee as well as the anticipated fall in Test and Trace activity. Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that, although there had been some early signs of a slowing in underlying growth, demand had remained mostly robust and broadly in line with projections at the time of the May Report . 16: There had been mixed signs on the extent to which the squeeze on real disposable incomes was weighing on household sentiment and spending. GfK consumer confidence had fallen further in May, to below the previous low point for the series in mid-2008. That weakness had been broad-based across backward and forward-looking sub-balances that fed into the headline confidence indicator. Other indicators of consumer spending had held up, however. Retail sales volumes had increased by 1.4% in April, following a decline of 1.2% in March. Faster indicators of spending had also suggested a continued recovery in previously subdued areas of consumer services, such as international travel, and resilience in other areas, such as restaurant reservations. Indicators of house prices had remained robust in the recent period and housing activity had fallen back. 17: Some indicators of corporate sector sentiment had weakened since the MPC’s previous meeting, although they had remained more resilient than indicators of consumer confidence and, based on pre-Covid relationships, were consistent with positive underlying GDP growth. The S&P Global/CIPS PMI composite output index had fallen in May, but had remained around its long-run average level. The composite output expectations series had also fallen. Other business survey indicators had continued to hold up. The CBI reported output balance and Lloyds trading expectations balance had both shown little change on the month. In addition, expected sales over the year ahead had remained strong in the May Decision Maker Panel results, although this indicator had fallen back somewhat over recent months. According to contacts of the Bank’s Agents, growth had continued to be held back by supply chain disruptions, although companies were increasingly taking measures to alleviate the effects of these disruptions, for example by using alternative inputs and holding more stock. 18: The Chancellor of the Exchequer had announced a £15 billion Cost of Living Support package on 26 May. This had included: a direct one-off payment of £650 for households on means-tested benefits; a payment of £300 to pensioners; and a £150 payment to people on disability benefits. There had been a doubling of the universal rebate through the Energy Bills Support Scheme, providing an additional £200 to households. The Chancellor had also announced that the original £200 rebate would no longer have to be repaid in subsequent years. The announced measures took effect over the second half of this year, with additional payments for households receiving means-tested benefits starting as soon as July. The payments to benefit recipients were skewed towards people on lower incomes. 19: Taken together, and using standard fiscal multipliers, initial Bank staff analysis suggested that these measures were likely to boost GDP by around 0.3% and raise CPI inflation by 0.1 percentage points in the first year, with some upside risks around these estimates given the targeted and front-loaded nature of some of the measures. Bank staff would conduct a detailed assessment of the new measures ahead of the August Monetary Policy Report. Supply, costs and prices 20: Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 9.0% in April, close to the May Monetary Policy Report projection. Energy and core goods inflation had continued to account for around 80% of the overshoot of CPI inflation relative to the 2% target. Food and services inflation had risen further and accounted for the remainder of the overshoot, with an increasing contribution from services prices, which was partly due to the restoration of the 20% VAT rate on the hospitality sector’s sales. Core CPI inflation, excluding food, beverages, tobacco and energy, had risen to 6.2%. The April CPI release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. 21: Higher inflation rates had become more widespread within the CPI basket. The inflation rates of around nine tenths of the 85 class level categories by weight in the CPI basket had been above their pre-pandemic averages in April, compared to around half in the summer of 2021. 22: The Committee discussed the strength of UK inflation from a cross-country perspective. Rates of consumer price inflation in the euro area and in the United States had also been elevated during the first half of this year. Based on a component level comparison, the Committee noted that energy price inflation had pushed up on measures of headline consumer price inflation to a similar extent in both the United Kingdom and the euro area, consistent with those regions’ greater exposure to European wholesale gas price increases, with a smaller effect in the United States. Core goods price inflation had been stronger in the United Kingdom than in other regions recently. It had risen to 8.0% in April, compared to 3.8% in the euro area for the same month and 6.4%, on the PCE measure, in the United States. The strength of food price inflation across the three economies had been similar in the latest data, partly reflecting the importance of global developments for agricultural prices. Services price inflation, which reflected domestic labour market conditions to a greater extent than other components of inflation, had been stronger in the United Kingdom and in the United States than in the euro area. 23: CPI inflation was expected to rise somewhat further in the near term, to just under 10% in September, reflecting higher food, core goods and services price inflation. The recent increase in oil prices would also push up on inflation relative to the May Report projection, by around a quarter of a percentage point. Core CPI inflation was expected to rise to just under 7% by September. 24: CPI inflation was then expected to rise to slightly above 11% in October, slightly higher than the monthly peak consistent with the May Report. The projected increase between September and October was expected to be due largely to the next reset of Ofgem’s utility price cap. If sustained, the latest wholesale gas futures prices would mean around a 40% increase in the utility price cap in October, similar to the expectation at the time of the May Report. Over two-thirds of the six-month observation window relevant for the reset of the October cap had now passed. Following the recent consultation, Ofgem’s decision on whether to increase the frequency at which the cap was reset was forthcoming. One outcome could be around a three-week extension to the current observation window, which provided some additional uncertainty around the magnitude of the increases in utility prices in October. For the period beyond October, staff estimates suggested that resetting the price cap on a quarterly, rather than semi-annual basis, had only modest implications for the CPI inflation projections, given the latest wholesale gas price futures curve. 25: The Government’s Cost of Living Support package had included a doubling of the universal rebate to households, which was due to take effect from October. The ONS’s announcement on the treatment of this rebate in economic statistics, including consumer prices, was forthcoming. 26: Survey indicators of cost and prices had remained elevated. The S&P Global/CIPS PMI composite input price index had risen to a record high level in May. The corresponding composite output price index had remained close to its record high. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported that manufacturing and services companies had continued to face elevated input prices, which businesses had continued to pass onto their prices in order to protect their margins. 27: Short-term measures of inflation expectations across households, businesses and financial markets had remained substantially elevated relative to their historic averages. The Bank/Ipsos and Citi/YouGov measures of households’ one-year ahead inflation expectations had been close to their record high levels recently. The Decision Maker Panel had reported a further increase in expectations for businesses’ year-ahead output price inflation, to 5.9% in the three months to May. 28: Medium to longer-term measures of inflation expectations had not been as elevated as their short-term counterparts, although they had, nevertheless, remained above their historic averages. Within this latter set of indicators, inflation compensation measures in financial markets had fallen modestly, but they had remained well above their average levels of the past decade. The expectations of professional forecasters reported in HM Treasury’s May survey had risen to around ½ percentage point above the inflation target of 2% at the two to three-year ahead horizons. However, this shift in the mean appeared to be due largely to the effect of a substantial upward revision by a single forecaster. The median of the distribution had remained close to 2% at these forecast horizons. The Committee would continue to monitor measures of inflation expectations very closely. 29: The ONS’s reweighting of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) with new population estimates had changed only marginally the composition of the labour market. In the three months to April, the unemployment rate was 3.8%, equal to its pre-pandemic trough and slightly lower than in the three months to January. LFS employment had grown strongly, by 0.5%. The inactivity rate had declined a little over recent months but was still higher than immediately before the pandemic. These labour market developments had been broadly consistent with the expectations made at the time of the May Report and with a tight labour market . Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) employee payrolls had risen by a further 90,000 in May, although these initial estimates had tended to be revised down somewhat subsequently. 30: Labour demand indicators had remained strong, alongside evidence of persistently elevated recruitment difficulties. The stock of vacancies had risen further, to 1.3 million in the three months to May. The vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, a measure of labour market tightness, remained elevated, within which the stock of vacancies was now broadly equal to the stock of unemployed people. Growth in the stock of vacancies had however slowed, from 5.4% in the three months to February to 1.6% in the three months to May. Recent employment indicators in business surveys and the REC labour demand index had remained strong. Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents’ contacts suggested that hiring intentions had continued to be positive and that recruitment difficulties had remained severe. Contacts had said that they expected recruitment difficulties to persist for at least the next twelve months, due to structural shortages of labour and skills. 31: Recent indicators of nominal pay growth had remained elevated, consistent with the continued effects of a tightening labour market. Nominal private sector regular AWE growth had been 4.8% in the three months to April, in line with the expectation at the time of the May Report. Adjusted for the mechanical effects of the changes in workforce composition and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, Bank staff estimated that underlying nominal private sector regular pay growth had remained above 4%, also consistent with expectations at the time of the May Report and in excess of pre-pandemic rates of around 3 to 3½%. HMRC PAYE measures of median pay growth had been in a range of 4 to 6¼% over recent months, also above pre-pandemic rates. Recent strong growth in bonus payments had been broad based when compared to pre-pandemic sectoral averages. The Bank’s Agents’ contacts had reported that one-off bonus payments had been used to address recruitment and retention difficulties. Given recent developments in market-sector productivity, these underlying nominal earnings indicators also appeared to be consistent with elevated rates of unit wage cost growth. 32: The Bank’s Agents had reported that pay settlements continued to be much higher than a year ago, with deals averaging just over 5%, a little above the 4.8% expected by companies in the Agents’ pay survey conducted near the beginning of this year. A significant minority of companies were considering mid-year top-ups to pay settlements. This recent intelligence reinforced the upside risk to the MPC’s central projections for pay growth and domestic price pressures highlighted in the May Report. The immediate policy decision 33: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 34: In the MPC’s central projections in the May Monetary Policy Report, UK GDP growth had been expected to slow sharply over the first half of the forecast period and, although the labour market had been expected to tighten slightly further in the near term, the unemployment rate had been projected to rise to 5½% in three years’ time. CPI inflation had been expected to average slightly over 10% at its peak in 2022 Q4. Conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate at that time and the MPC’s forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation had been projected to fall to a little above the 2% target in two years’ time, largely reflecting the waning influence of external factors, and to be well below the target in three years, mainly reflecting weaker domestic pressures. The risks to the inflation projection had been judged to be skewed to the upside at these points. 35: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy had recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. These shocks had pushed global energy and other tradable goods prices to elevated levels. Those price increases had raised UK inflation and, since the United Kingdom was a net importer of these items, would necessarily weigh on most UK households’ real incomes and many UK companies’ real profits. This real economic adjustment was something monetary policy was unable to prevent. These global shocks could interact with domestic factors, including the tight labour market and the pricing strategies of firms, and could lead to more persistent inflationary pressures. The role of monetary policy was to ensure that, as the adjustment in the real economy occurred, CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. 36: The latest output, business survey and consumer spending indicators had been mixed, and, taken together, did not suggest a materially different near-term underlying growth path to that projected in the May Report. The latest official data continued to suggest that momentum in labour market activity had been sustained, and there had been no signs from other timelier indicators of employment of an imminent deterioration. That was not in itself surprising as changes in labour market activity usually lagged developments in GDP by one or two quarters, but there was a risk that tightness in the labour market persisted for longer than expected. The Government’s recent fiscal package would be incorporated into the MPC’s updated projections for consumer spending and saving behaviour ahead of the August Report, and there were some reasons for a slightly bigger boost to growth and inflation than a standard multiplier framework would suggest. Although CPI inflation in April had been close to the MPC’s expectations at the time of the May Report, inflationary pressures appeared to have broadened across the major components of consumer prices, including in the services sector, and other indicators of cost and price pressures had remained robust. A key question remained about whether some self-sustaining momentum in domestically generated inflation would persist even as a margin of slack in the economy was expected to open up in due course. 37: In view of continuing signs of robust cost and price pressures, including the current tightness of the labour market, and the risk that those pressures became more persistent, all members of the Committee judged that an increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. 38: Six members of the Committee judged that a further 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 1.25%, was warranted at this meeting. These members noted that the economic news overall had been fairly limited relative to the May Report projections. CPI inflation had been projected to be some way below the 2% target in three years’ time in the May Report, and demand might be starting to slow in line with the May forecast. But the labour market remained tight and indications of broader domestic inflationary pressure required a response in order to ensure inflation returned sustainably to the target in the medium term. 39: Three members preferred a 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate at this meeting. These members put a higher weight on the prospect of more resilience in demand or shortfalls in supply or both, such that cost and capacity pressures would remain relatively strong over the forecast period. These members also judged that monetary policy should lean strongly against risks that recent trends in pay growth, firms’ pricing decisions, and inflation expectations in the economy more widely would become more firmly embedded. Faster policy tightening now would help to bring inflation back to the target sustainably in the medium term, and reduce the risks of a more extended and costly tightening cycle later. 40: The MPC would take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. The scale, pace and timing of any further increases in Bank Rate would reflect the Committee’s assessment of the economic outlook and inflationary pressures. The Committee would be particularly alert to indications of more persistent inflationary pressures, and would if necessary act forcefully in response. 41: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.25 percentage points, to 1.25%. 42: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members (Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann and Michael Saunders) voted against the proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.5%. Operational considerations 43: As of 15 June 2022, the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) was £866 billion, comprising £847 billion of UK government bond purchases and £19.3 billion of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases. 44: Consistent with the Committee’s decision at its February 2022 meeting to begin to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases, the £3.2 billion of cash flows associated with the redemption of the July 2022 gilt held by the APF would not be reinvested. 45: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Michael Saunders Silvana Tenreyro Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. 46: As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Sir Bradley Fried was also present on 8 June, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Committee expressed its thanks for his significant contribution to the Bank during his time as Chair of Court since 2018 and as a member of Court since 2012. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 3 August will be published on 4 August 2022.

At its meeting ending on 3 August 2022, the MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.75%. One member preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 1.5%. Inflationary pressures in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe have intensified significantly since the May Monetary Policy Report and the MPC’s previous meeting. That largely reflects a near doubling in wholesale gas prices since May, owing to Russia’s restriction of gas supplies to Europe and the risk of further curbs. As this feeds through to retail energy prices, it will exacerbate the fall in real incomes for UK households and further increase UK CPI inflation in the near term. CPI inflation is expected to rise more than forecast in the May Report, from 9.4% in June to just over 13% in 2022 Q4, and to remain at very elevated levels throughout much of 2023, before falling to the 2% target two years ahead. GDP growth in the United Kingdom is slowing. The latest rise in gas prices has led to another significant deterioration in the outlook for activity in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. The United Kingdom is now projected to enter recession from the fourth quarter of this year. Real household post-tax income is projected to fall sharply in 2022 and 2023, while consumption growth turns negative. Domestic inflationary pressures are projected to remain strong over the first half of the forecast period. Firms generally report that they expect to increase their selling prices markedly, reflecting the sharp rises in their costs. The labour market has remained tight, with the unemployment rate at 3.8% in the three months to May and vacancies at historically high levels. As a result, and consistent with the latest Agents’ survey, underlying nominal wage growth is expected to be higher than in the May Report over the first half of the forecast period. Inflationary pressures are nevertheless expected to dissipate over time. Global commodity prices are assumed to rise no further, and tradable goods price inflation is expected to fall back, the first signs of which may already be evident. Although the labour market may loosen only slowly in response to falling demand, unemployment is expected to rise from 2023. Domestic inflationary pressures are therefore expected to subside in the second half of the forecast period, as the increasing degree of economic slack and lower headline inflation reduce the pressure on wage growth. Monetary policy is also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2% target. The risks around the MPC’s projections from both external and domestic factors are exceptionally large at present. There is a range of plausible paths for the economy, which have CPI inflation and medium-term activity significantly higher or lower than in the baseline projections in the August Monetary Policy Report. As a result, in coming to its assessment of the outlook and its implications for monetary policy, the Committee is currently putting less weight on the implications of any single set of conditioning assumptions and projections. The August Report contains several projections for GDP, unemployment and inflation: a baseline conditioned on the MPC’s current convention for wholesale energy prices to remain constant beyond the six-month point; an alternative projection in which energy prices follow their downward-sloping futures curves throughout the forecast period; and a scenario which explores the implications of greater persistence in domestic price setting than in the baseline. These are all conditioned on announced Government fiscal policies, including the Cost of Living Support package announced in May. There are significant differences between these projections in the latter half of the forecast period. However, all show very high near-term inflation, a fall in GDP over the next year and a marked decline in inflation thereafter. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has continued to be subject to a succession of very large shocks, which will inevitably lead to volatility in output. Monetary policy will ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks occurs, CPI inflation will return to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. The labour market remains tight, and domestic cost and price pressures are elevated. There is a risk that a longer period of externally generated price inflation will lead to more enduring domestic price and wage pressures. In view of these considerations, the Committee voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.75%, at this meeting. The MPC will take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. Policy is not on a pre-set path. The Committee will, as always, consider and decide the appropriate level of Bank Rate at each meeting. The scale, pace and timing of any further changes in Bank Rate will reflect the Committee’s assessment of the economic outlook and inflationary pressures. The Committee will be particularly alert to indications of more persistent inflationary pressures, and will if necessary act forcefully in response. In the minutes of its May 2022 meeting, the Committee asked Bank staff to work on a strategy for selling UK government bonds (gilts) held in the Asset Purchase Facility and committed to providing an update at its August meeting. Based on this analysis, the Committee is provisionally minded to commence gilt sales shortly after its September meeting, subject to economic and market conditions being judged appropriate and to a confirmatory vote at that meeting. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 3 August 2022 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the backdrop of its latest economic projections, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The Committee also discussed its strategy for selling UK government bonds held in the Asset Purchase Facility. The international economy 2: UK-weighted global GDP growth was likely to have slowed in 2022 Q2, and was projected to remain weak in Q3. The latest rise in gas prices and, to a lesser extent, a tightening in financial conditions, had led to another significant deterioration in the outlook for global economic activity. 3: According to the preliminary flash estimate, euro-area GDP had grown by a higher-than-expected rate of 0.7% in 2022 Q2. This could in part have reflected tourism returning to pre-Covid-19 (Covid) levels as restrictions were eased. Since the May Monetary Policy Report, the euro-area unemployment rate had fallen further below pre-Covid levels, reaching 6.6% in June, while vacancies had continued to grow. However, forward-looking indicators, such as the S&P Global PMI composite output index and other business and consumer confidence survey balances had fallen sharply, indicating weaker GDP growth in Q3. 4: According to the advance estimate, US GDP had fallen by 0.2% in 2022 Q2, the second consecutive quarter of negative growth. While the fall had been mainly accounted for by lower stockbuilding, domestic final demand growth had also slowed. The unemployment rate had remained at 3.6%, while there were early signs of a levelling out of the increase in vacancies in high-frequency data. The US ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs had both fallen in June to their lowest readings since mid-2020, although they had remained above 50, indicating GDP growth could remain weak, but positive, in Q3. 5: China’s GDP had fallen by 2.6% in 2022 Q2, significantly weaker than had been expected and related largely to the strict regional lockdowns due to Covid and continued weakness in the property sector. GDP growth in Q3 was expected to recover, due to the easing of Covid restrictions. 6: European spot and futures gas prices had roughly doubled since the MPC’s previous meeting in mid-June, as the risks of Russia limiting severely the flow of gas to Europe had started to crystallise. The Dutch Title Transfer Facility spot price, a measure of European wholesale gas prices, had risen to around €200 per MWh, close to its peak around the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. In response to Russia’s restriction of gas flows, EU member countries had agreed to a voluntary 15% reduction in gas consumption until the spring of 2023. Prices of other commodities, such as food, oil, and metals, had fallen materially since the MPC’s previous meeting, with the movements in the latter two prices likely to have reflected a weakening near-term global growth outlook. 7: Indicators of global supply constraints had remained elevated, although there were some early signs that supply bottlenecks had started to ease. Some indicators of shipping costs had declined from their peaks, while PMI surveys indicated that manufacturing delivery times had fallen back across different regions. 8: High energy and other commodity prices, global supply bottlenecks and strong labour markets had contributed to increases in global inflation rates. Euro-area annual headline and core HICP inflation in July had increased to 8.9% and 4.0% respectively. In the United States, annual headline and core PCE inflation had increased to 6.8% and 4.8% in June respectively, and annual US CPI inflation had increased to 9.1% in June. Monetary and financial conditions 9: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, financial markets had continued to be volatile. Market participants now expected that central banks in major advanced economies would react more forcefully to near-term inflationary pressures, but could need to respond to weaker activity thereafter. Ten-year government bond yields had fallen by around 70, 80 and 90 basis points in the United Kingdom, United States and Germany respectively since the MPC’s June meeting, more than reversing the increases seen between the May and June meetings. Risky asset prices had recovered, following large declines in equity prices and increases in corporate bond spreads between the MPC’s May and June meetings. 10: A significant number of central banks globally had increased their policy rates over the past six weeks, including more than three quarters of the central banks for which the Bank for International Settlements published data. At its July meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee had increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, to 2¼ to 2½%. At its July meeting, the ECB Governing Council had raised its key policy interest rates by 50 basis points and had approved a Transmission Protection Instrument, to ensure that the monetary policy stance was transmitted smoothly across all euro-area countries as the Governing Council continued to normalise monetary policy. The near-term path for market-implied policy rates in both the United States and euro area implied a sharp pickup in rates in 2022, but thereafter flat-lined or fell back a little, at levels lower than at the time of the MPC’s previous meeting. 11: In the United Kingdom, market pricing was broadly consistent with an increase in Bank Rate of 50 basis points at this MPC meeting. Following the Governor’s announcement in his Mansion House speech on 19 July that the MPC would publish more details on its strategy for beginning to sell the gilts held in the Asset Purchase Facility alongside the August Monetary Policy Report, a majority of market participants now expected that such sales would begin shortly after the MPC’s September meeting. Expectations for the extent of these sales were little changed, according to respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS). 12: Further out, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate had fallen since the MPC’s previous meeting, now peaking at just under 3% in March 2023. This path continued to be higher than the expectations for Bank Rate of respondents to the latest MaPS, although the gap between the two paths had narrowed slightly, as the median respondent to MaPS now expected Bank Rate to peak at 2.5%, compared to 2% at the time of the MPC’s previous meeting. 13: Medium-term inflation compensation measures were lower across advanced economies, including the United Kingdom, than at the time of the May Report. That might have reflected concerns about the weaker global growth outlook, lower prices for some commodities, and tighter monetary policy in the near term. Medium-term UK inflation compensation measures had remained above their average levels of the past decade. 14: Based on the 15-working day average to 26 July on which the August Report had been conditioned, the sterling effective exchange rate was around 3% lower than the corresponding level at the time of the May Report. The depreciation of sterling against the US dollar had accounted for around 60% of this fall. Sterling had appreciated somewhat in the run-up to this MPC meeting. 15: Lending rates for new fixed-rate mortgages in the United Kingdom had continued to increase materially, reflecting a further response to the increases in risk-free market rates that had been observed since autumn 2021. The pass-through of these increases in risk-free rates to mortgage rates had been close to the full pass-through that had typically been seen prior to the global financial crisis, when interest rates had been further away from their lower bound. The latest Credit Conditions Survey suggested that secured credit availability for households had declined in the second quarter, with lenders reporting that this had largely reflected a worsening economic outlook. Respondents had expected secured credit availability to decrease slightly further in 2022 Q3. As usual, increases in interest rates on unsecured household borrowing and sight deposit rates had been smaller than for mortgage lending. Demand and output 16: Monthly GDP was estimated to have increased by 0.5% in May, following a 0.2% decline in April. The May outturn had been weaker than Bank staff had expected, but there was still uncertainty around the scale of the upward impact on activity from the additional trading day in May associated with the timing of the Platinum Jubilee bank holiday period. 17: Following a 0.8% quarterly increase in GDP in 2022 Q1, Bank staff now expected GDP to have fallen by 0.2% in Q2 as a whole, weaker than the 0.1% growth expected in the May Monetary Policy Report. Headline growth had been depressed by the run-down of NHS Test and Trace activity and by the impact of the Platinum Jubilee over the quarter as a whole. Bank staff had estimated that GDP growth excluding those factors was likely to have been around ½%, compared to around 1% in previous quarters. That was also slightly weaker than had been expected in the May Report, but broadly consistent with indicators of output growth from business surveys that had declined over the quarter. The slowdown in underlying growth was in part likely to be a reflection of the fall in real incomes due to higher global energy and tradable goods prices. 18: Most business survey indicators had weakened further in July. For example, the S&P Global/CIPS PMI composite output index had fallen from 53.7 in June to 52.1, below its long-run average but remaining consistent with positive GDP growth. Within the aggregate, there had been particular weakness in manufacturing output. The composite future output index had risen slightly in July, however. According to the Bank’s Agents, activity had grown at a moderate pace recently, with output constrained by ongoing shortages of labour and goods, and with companies reported to be more optimistic than households about the economic outlook. 19: Overall, Bank staff now expected GDP to increase by 0.4% in 2022 Q3, slightly weaker than had been incorporated in the May Report. With headline growth likely to be boosted by the unwind of the effect of the Platinum Jubilee, underlying growth was expected to slow further but to remain positive. 20: Following 0.5% growth in 2022 Q1, household consumption growth was expected to have slowed in Q2, with a further slowdown anticipated in Q3 to around 0.1% growth. Retail sales volumes had fallen by 0.1% in June, with particular weakness in clothing and footwear, and household goods stores. This had continued the downward trend in retail spending observed since the second half of 2021. According to the Bank’s Agents, there had been signs of consumer demand softening, as the fall in household real incomes was depressing spending. Food retailers had reported declines in sales volumes to the Agents, and there had also been widespread reports of a slowdown in sales of durable goods, which could be consistent with a change in the composition of spending. According to ONS data, output had surpassed its pre-pandemic level in some consumer-facing service sectors, such as hotels and restaurants, and land transport, but it was unclear whether the output of these sectors would rise much further in the near term. GfK consumer confidence had remained unchanged in July at the record-low level recorded in June. There had been some early indications of a slowing in housing demand in the June RICS survey. 21: Business investment had fallen by 0.6% in 2022 Q1 and had been persistently lower than expected in previous Monetary Policy Report projections. Relative to its pre-pandemic level, that weakness had been particularly apparent in investment in transport equipment and buildings and structures. Official data for business investment had been subject to significant revision in the past. According to the Bank’s Agents, investment intentions had softened slightly recently but had remained positive. Current investment spending had continued to be held back by cost pressures and shortages, and a greater number of the Agents’ contacts had indicated that uncertainty about demand might curtail investment in future. 22: Following changes in measurement associated with the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, it remained very difficult to interpret recent external trade data, including being able to make consistent comparisons in these series across time. Supply, costs and prices 23: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had been 3.8% in the three months to May, equal to its pre-pandemic trough and consistent with a tight labour market. LFS employment growth had been strong, picking up to 0.9% in the three months to May. The corollary of stable unemployment and strong employment growth had been a further decline in the inactivity rate. Nevertheless, the employment rate had remained somewhat below its level immediately prior to the pandemic, with the inactivity rate still somewhat higher than it had been during that earlier period. 24: Indicators of labour demand had remained strong, alongside evidence of continued recruitment difficulties. The stock of vacancies had been relatively stable in recent months, remaining close to its record high in the three months to June. The vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, a measure of labour market tightness, had also remained elevated and, on an industry basis, this ratio for each sector of the economy had been higher than its corresponding pre-pandemic level. The Bank’s Agents’ survey on employment and pay, conducted over the six weeks to early July, had reported strong employment intentions among businesses, although respondents had expected recruitment difficulties to limit these intentions being realised. Indeed, the Agents’ contacts had reported continued broad-based recruitment difficulties, with attrition and vacancy rates higher than normal for many businesses. 25: Indicators of nominal pay growth had remained strong, consistent with the effects of continued labour market tightness and higher CPI inflation outturns. Annual growth in private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had been 5% in the three months to May, broadly in line with expectations at the time of the May Monetary Policy Report. Adjusted for the mechanical effects of the changes in workforce composition and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, Bank staff estimated that underlying nominal private sector regular pay growth had been around 4½% in the three months to May, in excess of pre-pandemic rates of around 3 to 3½%. The HMRC PAYE measure of the median of pay growth had been around 5% in June, also above its pre-pandemic rate. 26: The Agents’ employment and pay survey had reported an increase in recent wage settlements relative to estimates from the broadly equivalent survey conducted at the start of 2022. This survey had also suggested that businesses expected to increase pay deals by around 6% over the next twelve months, which was a little higher than in the previous survey. A significant minority of respondents in the latest survey had not provided an expected pay settlement figure for the next twelve months, with some indicating that they preferred to wait to observe future CPI outturns before deciding. Given the expected path of CPI inflation in the coming months, this suggested a potential upside risk to pay growth in the near term. Around a quarter of respondents to the latest survey had given or were considering awarding one-off payments to compensate staff. Underlying private sector regular AWE pay growth was expected to pick up further, to around 6% over the second half of 2022, driven by persistent tightness in the labour market and by higher inflation. 27: The Government had recently announced pay awards for a broad set of public sector employees of around 4%, on average, which compared to an annual rate of public sector AWE regular pay growth of 1.8% in the three months to May. 28: Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 9.4% in June, 0.3 percentage points above the May Report projection. In contrast, core CPI inflation, excluding food, beverages and tobacco and energy, had fallen to 5.8%, around ½ percentage point below the expectation at the time of the May Report. Relative to the May Report, there had been upside news in fuel, food and, to a lesser extent, services prices. The softening in core CPI inflation had been accounted for by a deceleration in core goods prices, in large part reflecting outright falls in used car prices. Services inflation, which was more closely associated with domestically generated inflation, had risen further, to 5.2%. 29: CPI inflation was expected to rise to around 10% in July and remain at around this level through the rest of the third quarter, reflecting higher fuel, food and services prices. 30: In 2022 Q4, CPI inflation was expected to rise to just over 13%, about 3 percentage points higher than the expectation at the time of the May Report and more than 2 percentage points higher than at the time of the June MPC meeting. The majority of that upside news was due to higher expected household energy prices. That primarily reflected the very substantial rise in wholesale gas futures prices that had occurred since the May Report, most recently due to Russia’s restrictions of gas supplies to European markets in July and due to the risk of further curbs. Since May, sterling gas futures prices for end-2022 had nearly doubled. To a lesser extent, the upside news reflected Ofgem’s announced changes to the method for updating its price cap, which had been shared with the Bank in advance of publication. These changes included putting more weight on the most recent sharp increases in wholesale gas prices, via transitional observation windows. In the August Monetary Policy Report projections, the price cap was assumed to rise by around 75% in October, compared to around 40% in the May Report. That would increase the typical annual dual-fuel bill from just under £2,000 to around £3,500 in October. The switch to resetting the cap on a quarterly, rather than semi-annual, basis meant that the price cap would be reset again in January. 31: The direct contribution of energy to CPI inflation was projected to reach 6½ percentage points in 2022 Q4, nearly 2½ percentage points higher than in the May Report and expected to account for more than half of the overshoot of CPI inflation relative to the 2% target. The rise in energy prices was likely to have additional indirect effects on CPI inflation by increasing firms’ costs, which were then likely to be passed on to a wide range of prices for non-energy goods and services. Bank staff estimated that these indirect effects would contribute around 1 percentage point to CPI inflation in 2022 Q4 and, assuming gas prices followed the Monetary Policy Report conditioning assumption, would continue to add significantly to inflation during the following year. 32: Core CPI inflation was also expected to pick up again in the near term, reaching around 6¼% by the end of the year, largely reflecting strengthening services price inflation. Indicators of costs and prices more broadly had remained elevated, although recent developments had been mixed. The S&P Global/CIPS PMI composite input and output indicators had fallen back somewhat in July from their recent highs. The inflation rates of the ONS’s measures of both producer output prices and services producer prices had risen further, to historically elevated levels. The Agents’ contacts had reported that input price inflation had remained elevated and that many companies expected to pass higher costs into prices to protect their margins, which remained below normal. 33: Short-term measures of inflation expectations across households, businesses and financial markets had remained substantially elevated relative to their historical averages. Respondents to the Decision Maker Panel had increased their expectations for their own price increases over the next twelve months to 6.6% on average in July, from 6.3% in June. The 2022 Q2 Deloitte CFO Survey had reported a median expectation for CPI inflation of 3.4% in two years’ time. Two-year ahead expectations reported in the CBI Distributive Trades Survey had remained above its historical average in 2022 Q2. The Citi/YouGov measure of households’ expectations at the one-year horizon had edged down in July but had remained at historically elevated levels. Households’ short-term inflation expectations tended to move more in line with measured inflation rates than equivalent indicators of medium-term inflation expectations. 34: Most medium to longer-term measures of inflation expectations had remained above their historical averages, albeit to a less extent than their short-term counterparts. Financial market indicators of medium-term inflation expectations had fallen from their recent highs to a level that was still above historical averages. The Citi/YouGov indicator of households’ expectations at the five to ten-year horizon had eased by 0.2 percentage points to 3.8% in July but had remained at a historically elevated level. The Bank’s Survey of Economic Forecasters, published in the August Report, had a median expectation for CPI inflation of 2% at the three-year horizon. The Committee would continue to monitor measures of inflation expectations very closely. The immediate policy decision 35: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 36: Inflationary pressures in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe had intensified significantly since the May Monetary Policy Report and the MPC’s previous meeting. That largely reflected a near doubling in wholesale gas prices since May, owing to Russia’s restriction of gas supplies to Europe and the risk of further curbs. As this fed through to retail energy prices, it would exacerbate the fall in real incomes for UK households and further increase UK CPI inflation in the near term. CPI inflation was expected to rise more than forecast in the May Report, from 9.4% in June to just over 13% in 2022 Q4, and to remain at very elevated levels throughout much of 2023, before falling to the 2% target two years ahead. 37: UK GDP growth was slowing in underlying terms and to a slightly greater extent than had been expected previously. This was in part a reflection of the fall in real incomes due to higher global energy and tradable goods prices, as well as constraints on output from ongoing shortages of labour and goods. Companies had remained more optimistic about the economic outlook than households. The labour market was tight but not tightening further. The United Kingdom was now projected to enter recession from the fourth quarter of this year. 38: The Agents’ employment and pay survey had reported that businesses expected to increase pay by around 6% over the next twelve months, a little higher than in their previous survey. Indicators of consumer and producer services price inflation had risen further in the latest data, although there had been some moderation in core consumer goods inflation. Respondents to the Decision Maker Panel had increased further their expectations for their own price increases over the next twelve months. Most other measures of inflation expectations had remained elevated, particularly in the near term, although financial market indicators of medium-term inflation expectations were lower than their recent highs. 39: The risks around the MPC’s projections from both external and domestic factors were exceptionally large at present. There was a range of plausible paths for the economy, which had CPI inflation and medium-term activity significantly higher or lower than in the baseline projections in the August Monetary Policy Report. As a result, in coming to its assessment of the outlook and its implications for monetary policy, the Committee was currently putting less weight on the implications of any single set of conditioning assumptions and projections. 40: The August Report contained several projections for GDP, unemployment and inflation: a baseline conditioned on the MPC’s current convention for wholesale energy prices to remain constant beyond the six-month point; an alternative projection in which energy prices followed their downward-sloping futures curves throughout the forecast period; and a scenario which explored the implications of greater persistence in domestic price setting than in the baseline. These were all conditioned on announced Government fiscal policies, including the Cost of Living Support package announced in May. There were significant differences between these projections in the latter half of the forecast period. However, all showed very high near-term inflation, a fall in GDP over the next year and a marked decline in inflation thereafter. 41: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy had continued to be subject to a succession of very large shocks, which would inevitably lead to volatility in output. These shocks had pushed global energy and other tradable goods prices to elevated levels. Those price increases had raised UK inflation and, since the United Kingdom was a net importer of these items, would necessarily weigh on households’ real incomes. This real economic adjustment was something monetary policy was unable to prevent. These global shocks could interact with domestic factors, including the tight labour market and the pricing strategies of firms, and could lead to more persistent inflationary pressures. The role of monetary policy was to ensure that, as the adjustment in the real economy occurred, CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. 42: The labour market remained tight, and domestic cost and price pressures were elevated. There was a risk that a longer period of externally generated price inflation would lead to more enduring domestic price and wage pressures. In view of these considerations, all members of the Committee judged that an increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. 43: Eight members of the Committee judged that a 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 1.75%, was warranted at this meeting. For these members, a more forceful policy action was justified. Against the backdrop of another jump in energy prices, there had been indications that inflationary pressures were becoming more persistent and broadening to more domestically driven sectors. In a tight labour market and an environment in which companies were finding it easier to pass on price increases, a higher and more protracted path for CPI inflation over the next 18 months could increase the risk that an eventual decline in external price pressures would not be sufficient to restrain expectations of above-target inflation further ahead. Some of these members also judged that spending could be stronger than was assumed in the August Report projections if, for example, the labour market proved more resilient or some households drew down their accumulated savings to a greater extent. Overall, a faster pace of policy tightening at this meeting would help to bring inflation back to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, and to reduce the risks of a more extended and costly tightening cycle later. 44: One member preferred a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate at this meeting. For this member, Bank Rate might already have reached the level consistent with returning inflation to the 2% target in the medium term. Demand would continue its recent slowing as household incomes were squeezed further and as past Bank Rate increases took full effect. Set against that, the labour market remained tight, and underlying wages and services prices had recently accelerated. While slowing demand would lower these domestic inflationary pressures, there was uncertainty over how much and how quickly this would occur. This member also shared concerns that the high near-term rate of CPI inflation would lead to second-round effects, prolonging the period of above-target inflation. Policy could act against those effects by generating a greater degree of slack and at the risk of oversteering medium-term inflation below target. Balancing these considerations, this member agreed that a further tightening was appropriate at this meeting, but felt that a smaller increase in Bank Rate would help minimise the risks, while retaining the option to act more forcefully if required at future meetings. 45: The MPC would take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. Policy was not on a pre-set path. The Committee would, as always, consider and decide the appropriate level of Bank Rate at each meeting. The scale, pace and timing of any further changes in Bank Rate would reflect the Committee’s assessment of the economic outlook and inflationary pressures. The Committee would be particularly alert to indications of more persistent inflationary pressures, and would if necessary act forcefully in response. 46: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.75%. 47: Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders) voted in favour of the proposition. One member (Silvana Tenreyro) voted against the proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 1.5%. The MPC’s strategy for UK government bond sales 48: As set out in the minutes of its May 2022 meeting, the Committee had asked Bank staff to work on a strategy for selling UK government bonds (gilts) held in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) and had committed to providing an update at its August meeting. This would allow the Committee to make a decision at a subsequent meeting on whether the Bank of England should commence gilt sales. 49: The process of reducing the size of the APF had begun in February 2022, when the Committee had voted to cease gilt reinvestments and to initiate sales of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bonds. 50: In line with previous communications on APF reduction, the Committee’s strategy for asset sales would be guided by a set of key principles. First, the Committee had a preference to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Second, sales would be conducted so as not to disrupt the functioning of financial markets. Third, to help achieve that, sales would be conducted in a relatively gradual and predictable manner over a period of time. 51: In the run-up to this MPC meeting, Bank staff had set out a framework for assessing whether conditions were appropriate for the Bank of England to start gilt sales, consistent with these key principles. Using this framework, Bank staff had briefed the MPC on the current state of economic and market conditions, including whether these would be consistent with sales being conducted without disrupting the functioning of financial markets. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) had also been briefed. 52: Based on the staff’s analysis, the MPC was provisionally minded to commence gilt sales shortly after its September policy meeting, subject to economic and market conditions being judged appropriate and to a confirmatory vote at that meeting. The Committee had asked the Bank to be in a position to begin a sales programme before the end of September. 53: In the event that this should proceed, the MPC agreed to set an amount for the reduction in the stock of purchased gilts held in the APF over a twelve-month period from the point at which the policy was voted on, comprising both maturing gilts and gilt sales. The Committee judged that, over the first twelve months of a sales programme starting in September, a reduction in the stock of purchased gilts held in the APF of around £80 billion was likely to be appropriate. Given the profile of maturing gilts over this period, this would imply a sales programme of around £10 billion per quarter. 54: The planned details of the proposed programme were set out in a provisional Market Notice accompanying these minutes. 55: For following years, the MPC intended to set an amount for the reduction in the stock of purchased gilts over the subsequent twelve-month period, as part of an annual review. As such, the Committee could amend the design parameters of the sales programme as required, for example to take into account the variation in gilt maturities across those periods. 56: The MPC agreed that there would be a high bar for amending the planned reduction in the stock of purchased gilts outside a scheduled annual review. That was in order to remain consistent with the principles that Bank Rate should be the active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and that unwind should be predictable. If such amendments were judged necessary in order to meet its remit, for example if potential movements in Bank Rate alone were judged insufficient to meet the inflation target, or if markets were judged to be very distressed, the MPC would first consider amending or halting the sales programme before considering restarting reinvestments or additional asset purchases. The FPC would also have a role through its assessment of financial stability. Operational considerations 57: On 3 August 2022 the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) was £863 billion, comprising £844 billion of UK government bond purchases and £19.1 billion of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases. 58: Consistent with the Committee’s decision at its February 2022 meeting to begin to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets, the £5.9 billion of cash flows associated with the redemption of the September 2022 gilt held by the APF would not be reinvested. 59: Consistent with the Committee’s decision at its February 2022 meeting to begin to reduce the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets and by a programme of corporate bond sales to be completed no earlier than towards the end of 2023 that should unwind fully the stock of corporate bond purchases, the Bank would begin sales of corporate bonds in the week commencing 19 September 2022, with operational details to be published around a month ahead of auctions commencing. 60: The Committee had been briefed on operational changes to the Sterling Monetary Framework that would come into effect alongside the start of a gilt sales programme. The Bank would launch a new Short Term Repo (STR) facility to help to ensure that short-term market rates remained close to Bank Rate, and to allow the MPC to make future decisions about APF unwind independently of the implications for the supply of reserves. Alongside these minutes, the Bank was publishing an Explanatory Note setting out the broader framework for controlling short-term interest rates during the APF reduction programme, and a Market Notice describing the STR in more detail. 61: Finally, on behalf of the Committee, the Chair expressed his appreciation to Michael Saunders for his contributions to the work of the MPC since becoming a member in 2016. 62: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Michael Saunders Silvana Tenreyro Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 14 September will be published on 15 September 2022.

Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 21 September 2022 ( PDF 0.2MB) PDF Close dialog Published on 22 September 2022 Monetary Policy Summary, September 2022 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 21 September 2022, the MPC voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 2.25%. Five members voted to raise Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, three members preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.75 percentage points, to 2.5%, and one member preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 2%. The Committee also voted unanimously to reduce the stock of purchased UK government bonds, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £80 billion over the next twelve months, to a total of £758 billion, in line with the strategy set out in the minutes of the August MPC meeting. In the August Monetary Policy Report, the MPC noted that the risks around its projections from both external and domestic factors were exceptionally large, given the very large increase in wholesale gas prices since May and the consequent impacts on real incomes for UK households and on CPI inflation. Since August, wholesale gas prices have been highly volatile, and there have been large moves in financial markets, including a sharp increase in government bond yields globally. Sterling has depreciated materially over the period. Uncertainty around the outlook for UK retail energy prices has nevertheless fallen, following the Government’s announcements of support measures including an Energy Price Guarantee. The Guarantee is likely to limit significantly further increases in CPI inflation, and reduce its volatility, while supporting aggregate private demand relative to the Committee’s August projections. An additional Growth Plan announcement is scheduled to take place shortly after this MPC meeting, which is expected to provide further fiscal support, and is likely to contain news that is material for the economic outlook. Once this announcement has been made, and as part of its November MPC round, the Committee will make a full assessment of the impact on demand and inflation from all these announcements, along with other news, and determine further implications for monetary policy. There has been some modest downside news to underlying UK GDP growth in 2022 Q3, and faster indicators and contacts of the Bank’s Agents suggest that the level of consumer spending is likely to have peaked in this quarter. There have been some indications that the demand for labour is weakening, although the labour market nonetheless tightened further over the summer, with inactivity materially higher than anticipated. Consumer services prices and nominal wages have continued to rise more rapidly than expected, although core goods price inflation has been lower than expected. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell slightly from 10.1% in July to 9.9% in August, with the release triggering the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that is being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Given the Energy Price Guarantee, the peak in measured CPI inflation is now likely to be lower than projected in the August Report, at just under 11% in October. Nevertheless, energy bills will still go up and, combined with the indirect effects of higher energy costs, inflation is expected to remain above 10% over the following few months, before starting to fall back. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Monetary policy will ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continues, CPI inflation will return to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy is also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2% target. There have been further signs since the August Report of continuing strength in domestically generated inflation. In and of itself, the Government’s Energy Price Guarantee will lower and bring forward the expected peak of CPI inflation. For the duration of the Guarantee, this might be expected to reduce the risk that a long period of externally generated price inflation leads to more persistent domestic price and wage pressures, although that risk remains material. The labour market is tight and domestic cost and price pressures remain elevated. While the Guarantee reduces inflation in the near term, it also means that household spending is likely to be less weak than projected in the August Report over the first two years of the forecast period. All else equal, and relative to that forecast, this would add to inflationary pressures in the medium term. In view of these considerations, the Committee voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 2.25%, at this meeting. The MPC will take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. Policy is not on a pre-set path. The Committee will, as always, consider and decide the appropriate level of Bank Rate at each meeting. The scale, pace and timing of any further changes in Bank Rate will reflect the Committee’s assessment of the economic outlook and inflationary pressures. Should the outlook suggest more persistent inflationary pressures, including from stronger demand, the Committee will respond forcefully, as necessary. At its August meeting, the MPC had communicated that it was provisionally minded to commence gilt sales shortly after its September meeting, subject to economic and market conditions being appropriate. At this meeting, the Committee agreed that the conditions were appropriate, and voted to begin the sale of UK government bonds held in the Asset Purchase Facility shortly after this meeting. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 21 September 2022 1: Members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) wished to express their heartfelt condolences to the Royal Family, following the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. 2: This meeting, which had originally been scheduled to end on 14 September, had been postponed by one week in light of the period of national mourning. Ahead of the rescheduled meeting, in order to support its deliberations, the Committee had received a further briefing from Bank staff on recent economic and financial developments. 3: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 4: UK-weighted global GDP growth appeared to be slowing in 2022 Q3, with data coming in a touch below the already weak expectations at the time of the August Monetary Policy Report. Wholesale gas prices had been highly volatile since the MPC’s previous meeting, adding to uncertainty around projected inflation dynamics and the degree to which the real disposable income of households would be reduced going forward. 5: GDP in the euro area was expected to be flat in 2022 Q3, in line with the August Report, following stronger-than-expected growth of 0.8% in Q2. In the United States, GDP was expected to grow by 0.2% in the third quarter, marginally lower than had been anticipated in the August Report, following Q2 GDP growth of -0.1%, which had been weaker than expected. Manufacturing PMIs had softened across both economies over July and August, while the services PMI had remained robust in the United States, though had dipped below 50 in the euro area in August. Consumer and business confidence indicators had continued to fall in both regions in July, but had stabilised in August, with US consumer confidence measures increasing notably. Labour markets had remained strong. The US unemployment rate had fallen in July, matching its February 2020 pre-pandemic level, but had ticked up a little in August to 3.7%, as the participation rate had increased. In the euro area, the unemployment rate had fallen to 6.6% in July, the lowest on record. Vacancy rates had stabilised over recent months in both economies, albeit at high levels, and wage growth although moderating a little, had remained strong. 6: China’s GDP growth was likely to be weaker in 2022 Q3 than had been anticipated at the time of the August Report. In July, fixed asset investment and industrial production had fallen, and the rate of growth in retail sales had slowed, although these indicators had picked up again in August. Taken together, these data suggested that the recovery from strict regional lockdowns earlier in the year due to Covid-19 (Covid) outbreaks was bumpy. The property market had continued to weaken, with secondary market property prices declining moderately in August for the twelfth consecutive month. Manufacturing PMIs had been below 50 in August, in part driven by a drought in southern China that had been affecting electricity supply. Services PMIs, while above 50, had fallen, reflecting the impact of renewed Covid lockdowns in some regions in recent months. Against this backdrop, the People’s Bank of China had cut lending rates, and the government had announced further credit and fiscal easing measures. 7: Inflationary pressures had remained strong in advanced economies. In the euro area, annual HICP inflation had increased by 0.2 percentage points to 9.1% in August, with core inflation increasing by a similar amount to 4.3%. While energy price increases had made the biggest contribution to annual headline inflation, increases on the month were due to increases in contributions from food and core goods prices. In the United States, annual headline CPI inflation had fallen in August, to 8.3%, from 8.5% in July, but annual core CPI inflation had risen to 6.3% from 5.9%, above market expectations. The easing in the headline CPI measure had been accounted for by a fall in the contribution from energy, while the increase in the core CPI measure had been accounted for in large part by higher core services inflation. These CPI data were consistent with annual headline PCE inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) target variable, having fallen to 6.0% in August and core PCE inflation having remained unchanged at 4.6%. 8: European gas spot and futures prices had been highly volatile since the MPC’s previous meeting. They had risen during most of August from an already high level given strong demand: European countries had continued to build gas stocks at pace ahead of winter, in part to mitigate the risk of a potential cessation in Russian gas supplies. Following a short period of easing prices in late August, that risk had largely crystallised in early September when Russia closed the Nordstream 1 pipeline, leading to a further price spike. Prices had remained volatile subsequently. At the time of this MPC meeting, the Dutch Title Transfer Facility spot price, a measure of European wholesale gas prices, stood at around €210 per MWh, around 25% higher than in the August Report. Several policy measures had been announced by EU governments and suggested by the European Commission that were aimed at reducing the burden from high energy bills on households and companies. 9: Prices of other commodities, including oil and metals, had eased since the August Report, potentially reflecting market participants adjusting downwards their expectations of the global economic outlook. The Brent crude oil spot price had fallen by around 10% to $93 per barrel. Agricultural prices had risen, driven in part by weather-related disruption, as hot weather across Europe, America, and Asia had affected supply. There had been further evidence that supply chain disruptions might be easing, with shipping costs declining appreciably. Monetary and financial conditions 10: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, there had been large and volatile movements in financial markets globally, and particularly in the United Kingdom. Market participants expected that central banks in major advanced economies would continue to react strongly to near-term inflationary pressures. Yields had also moved materially higher at longer horizons, which contrasted to June and July. Ten-year government bond yields had increased by around 150, 80 and 110 basis points in the United Kingdom, United States and Germany respectively. Equity prices globally had ended the period lower than at the time of the MPC’s August meeting, although corporate bond spreads had been little changed. 11: The near-term path for market-implied policy rates had picked up sharply across major advanced economies since the MPC’s August meeting. At its meeting on 8 September, the ECB Governing Council had raised its key policy interest rates by 75 basis points, in line with prior market expectations. Market contacts expected that the FOMC would increase the target range for the federal funds rate by at least 75 basis points at its meeting ending on 21 September. 12: The median respondent to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected Bank Rate to be increased by 50 basis points at this meeting, while market-implied pricing was consistent with an increase in Bank Rate of between 50 and 75 basis points. The Committee was also expected to confirm its plans, as set out in the August minutes, to commence gilt sales and reduce the stock of purchased gilts held in the Asset Purchase Facility by around £80 billion over the next twelve months. 13: Further out, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate had risen sharply since the MPC’s previous meeting, now peaking at around 4¾% in mid-2023. The increase in the path for market-implied policy rates since August had been significantly larger in the United Kingdom than in the United States or the euro area. The peak in UK rates was higher than the corresponding peaks for the United States and the euro area, which now reached 4.5% and 2.8% respectively. According to market participants, the rise in UK rates had reflected a number of factors, including the impact of increases in natural gas prices, news about domestic inflationary pressures, and expectations of fiscal easing. The market-implied path for Bank Rate continued to be higher than the expectations for Bank Rate of respondents to MaPS. The median respondent expected Bank Rate to peak at around 3½% in March 2023, with the gap between this and the market-implied path being ascribed mainly to a combination of domestic and global factors skewing risks to the upside. 14: Medium-term inflation compensation measures across advanced economies had been quite volatile since the MPC’s August meeting, and had ended the period little changed in the United States but somewhat higher in the euro area. UK measures, which had fallen steadily from their recent peaks in March 2022, had troughed in late July and then had been volatile. These UK measures had ended the period somewhat higher than at the time of the August MPC meeting, and remained well above their average levels of the past decade. 15: The sterling effective exchange rate had depreciated by around 4½% since the previous MPC meeting, and was now around 3% lower compared to the 15-day moving average on which the August Report projections had been conditioned. The fall over this period had been relatively broad-based against other major currencies. 16: Lending rates for new fixed-rate mortgages in the United Kingdom had increased further in August across all loan-to-value (LTV) categories, by between 8 and 25 basis points. This had principally reflected a further response to the increases in risk-free market rates that had been observed since autumn 2021, although rates on high LTV mortgages had only just returned to around their peaks during Covid. There had also been some indications of reduced mortgage credit availability, primarily reflecting a response to the worsening economic outlook rather than a reduction in lenders’ risk appetite. Interest rates on unsecured household borrowing had also increased, but as usual by less than the corresponding risk-free reference rates. Also as usual, the pass-through of reference rate rises to deposit rates was greater for term than for sight deposit rates. 17: The Committee discussed the broader impact so far of the recent tightening in UK monetary policy. Increases in risk-free market rates since autumn 2021 had led to higher retail bank lending rates with around the full degree of pass-through that had typically been seen prior to the global financial crisis. Relative to past tightening cycles, there was a larger share of borrowers with fixed-rate mortgage debt, who would be shielded from higher rates for a time, but who would face a higher jump in rates when they did need to refinance. Households might have experienced an increase in the value of their houses over that period, which could dampen the effect on consumer spending. The MPC would continue to monitor closely the transmission of its monetary policy actions. Demand and output 18: According to the ONS’s first quarterly estimate, UK GDP had fallen by 0.1% in 2022 Q2, slightly above the expectations of a 0.2% fall incorporated into the August Monetary Policy Report projection. The upside news had reflected a smaller-than-expected impact from the additional bank holiday for the Platinum Jubilee in June, with the staff assessment of underlying GDP growth for Q2 remaining unchanged at around ½%. Within the expenditure components, household consumption had fallen by 0.1% on the quarter, total government expenditure had fallen by 3.9%, partly reflecting the extensive roll-back of Test and Trace activity, and business investment had risen by 3.8%. 19: Monthly GDP had risen by 0.2% in July, weaker than expectations at the time of the August Report, reflecting some modest downside news to underlying growth that was expected to slow in 2022 Q3. The downside news came from manufacturing and construction output. Services output had risen in July in line with expectations. Bank staff now expected GDP to fall by 0.1% in Q3, below the August Report projection of 0.4% growth, and a second successive quarterly decline. That fall would also, in part, reflect the smaller-than-expected bounce back in growth following the bank holiday in Q2 and the expected impact from the additional bank holiday in September for the Queen’s state funeral. 20: The expected slowing in underlying growth in 2022 Q3 was consistent with weakness in the latest business surveys. The S&P Global/CIPS PMI composite output index had fallen in July and again in August, reaching 49.6, the first time it had fallen below the 50 level since early 2021. Other business survey indicators had also pointed to near-term growth being close to zero. The composite PMI output expectations series had fallen in the three months to August. According to contacts of the Bank’s Agents, growth in manufacturing output had continued to be held back by supply chain disruptions, although to a slightly lesser extent than in recent quarters, but demand had also weakened. Business investment intentions were also reported to be easing, with firms citing uncertainty about demand and the broader economic outlook, and rising costs. 21: The squeeze on real disposable incomes had continued to impact negatively on household spending. Retail sales volumes had fallen by 1.6% in August, continuing a downward trend since mid-2021, and the fall had been broad-based across the main components. Some faster indicators of consumer-facing services, such as travel and transport, had flattened off over recent months, although this had partly reflected the impact of strikes. According to contacts of the Bank’s Agents, spending in some parts of the hospitality sector had fallen over the summer compared with a year ago. A number of indicators of housing activity had weakened in the three months to August, although house prices had remained strong. The ONS UK house price index had picked up in July, following a fall in the three months to June. Supply, costs and prices 22: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen slightly to 9.9% in August, in line with expectations at the time of the August Monetary Policy Report. This outturn had triggered the exchange of letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was published alongside these minutes. Core CPI inflation, excluding food, beverages and tobacco and energy, had risen slightly to 6.3%, also in line with expectations at the time of the August Report. Core goods inflation had been stable at 6.6%, below expectations at the time of the August Report, but services inflation had risen to 5.9% in August, the second month in a row of upside news. Annual services inflation had remained high across a broad range of sectors. 23: On 8 September, the Government had announced the Energy Price Guarantee, which would cap household unit energy prices at a level consistent with a typical annual household dual-fuel bill of £2,500 from October for a period of two years. As for consumers, there would be support for all businesses, charities and public sector organisations in meeting energy bills, for a six-month period. After this initial six-month scheme, the Government would provide ongoing focused support for vulnerable industries. The Energy Bills Support Scheme, which had been extended in May and would provide a £400 universal rebate on energy bills to households, would also help them with the rise in energy bills. The ONS had announced in August that this one-off payment would not affect headline CPI inflation, in line with expectations at the time of the August Report. 24: The introduction of the Energy Price Guarantee meant that CPI inflation was expected to rise by less in the near term, peaking at a little under 11% in October. The rise in inflation reflected the impact of the further increase in energy prices in the CPI as they rose to the level of the Guarantee. The Government’s announcements would reduce significantly the degree to which energy prices, which had seen a sequence of rises over the course of the year, would contribute to the level of headline CPI inflation. The direct contribution of energy to annual CPI inflation was now projected to be around 4 percentage points in 2022 Q4, compared to around 6½ percentage points at the time of the August Report. By the start of 2023, the near-term inflation outlook was a little over 5 percentage points lower than would have been the case had household energy bills risen with the announced increase in the Ofgem price cap from October, and with the increase in the cap in January that would have been expected under the existing Ofgem framework, given the recent behaviour of wholesale gas prices. 25: There had been some easing in the composite input and output price PMIs, but these had remained elevated relative to their historical averages. Over July and August, the Agents’ contacts had noted that energy costs, pay and the depreciation of sterling were becoming increasingly important factors in cost pressures facing companies. Bank staff expected core CPI inflation to stay close to the current level in coming months, elevated relative to historical averages. 26: While getting a precise steer on inflation expectations was difficult, short-term measures of inflation expectations had increased further on the month and had remained substantially higher than past averages. There had been mixed signals from medium to longer-term measures of inflation expectations, although for most measures their level had also remained elevated relative to historical averages. The Citi/YouGov indicator of household expectations at the five to ten-year horizon had risen, but the Bank’s Inflation Attitudes Survey five-year inflation expectations measure had fallen back. Year-ahead CPI inflation expectations from the Decision Maker Panel of firms had remained elevated relative to the inflation target in August. The Committee would continue to monitor measures of inflation expectations very closely. 27: Regarding the labour market, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) measure of employment growth in the three months to July had slowed to 0.1%, from 0.5% in the three months to June. Both outturns had been weaker than the MPC’s expectations at the time of the August Report. The easing in employment growth might have reflected continued recruitment difficulties and perhaps some early signs of weakening labour demand, in particular in the manufacturing sector. In August there had been a small fall in vacancies across the economy as a whole. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported that recruitment difficulties might have moderated somewhat recently. Employment surveys had been softening in recent months. However, they remained near their historical averages and were consistent with ongoing positive employment growth. 28: The LFS unemployment rate had fallen to 3.6% in the three months to July, its lowest level since 1974 and below expectations at the time of the August Report. Since the start of 2022, however, the unemployment rate had remained broadly flat. The June and July releases indicated that inactivity had been significantly higher than expected at the time of the August Report, with a particularly large increase in July. The MPC discussed the surprising strength in inactivity, which had continued to be a key component of the tightness in the labour market. While flows out of inactivity had recently been strong, flows into inactivity had remained high. LFS survey responses indicated that a large proportion of the rise in inactivity was met by a rise in workers aged above 64 or those at working age who did not want a job. 29: Annual whole-economy total pay growth had been 5.5% in the three months to July, 0.3 percentage points higher than in the three months to June, and 0.6 percentage points higher than the expectation at the time of the August Report. Private sector regular pay had risen by 6.0% in the three months to July, stronger than the expectations of 5.5% at the time of the August Report, and bonuses had also surprised to the upside. The mechanical effects of the changes in workforce composition and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme on pay growth had been fading, such that headline nominal private sector regular pay growth was now a more informative indicator of underlying pay growth than it had been at any point since the onset of the pandemic. 30: Nominal pay growth was expected to rise further by the end of the year. The Agents’ contacts had reported that the current and expected high level of inflation, as well as industrial disputes, had been playing an increasing role in pay awards. A significant proportion of firms had given, or had been considering giving, their staff one-off payments to help with rising living costs or were reviewing their broader remuneration packages. The immediate policy decision 31: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 32: The most material economic news since the MPC’s previous meeting had been on fiscal policy, with the announcement of the Government’s response to the energy price shock and the scheduling of an additional Growth Plan announcement. 33: Against a backdrop of very significant rises in wholesale gas prices in recent months, the Government had announced a package of measures to support households and businesses with their energy bills, including an Energy Price Guarantee. The Guarantee would have the effect of reducing the near-term outlook for CPI inflation compared both with a counterfactual scenario in which there had been no policy action, and, to a lesser degree, relative to the August Monetary Policy Report projection, which also had no policy action but had been based on the lower path for gas prices at the time. It would also limit the reduction in household spending over the first two years compared with the very weak August Report projection. The scheme would therefore act primarily to offset some of the impacts of the externally generated energy price shock on households and businesses. The Government had also announced that a Growth Plan would be set out on 23 September. 34: Since August, wholesale gas prices had been highly volatile, and there had been large moves in financial markets, including a sharp increase in government bond yields globally. Sterling had depreciated materially over the period. There had been some modest downside news to underlying UK GDP growth in Q3, and faster indicators and contacts of the Bank’s Agents had suggested that the level of consumer spending was likely to have peaked in Q3. There had been some indications that the demand for labour was weakening, although the labour market had nonetheless tightened further over the summer, with inactivity materially higher than anticipated at the time of the August Report. Consumer services prices and nominal wages had continued to rise more rapidly than expected, although core goods price inflation had been lower than expected. 35: In the August Report, the MPC had noted that the risks around its projections from both external and domestic factors were exceptionally large, given the very large rise in wholesale gas prices since May and the consequent impacts on real incomes for UK households and on CPI inflation. The announced Energy Price Guarantee was expected to have the effect of significantly reducing the degree of uncertainty around the outlook for UK retail energy prices over the period of the Guarantee, and therefore also for CPI inflation. 36: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy had been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Monetary policy would ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continued, CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. 37: There had been further signs since the August Report of continuing strength in domestically generated inflation. In and of itself, the Government’s Energy Price Guarantee would lower and bring forward the expected peak of CPI inflation. For the duration of the Guarantee, this might have been expected to reduce the risk that a long period of externally generated price inflation led to more persistent domestic price and wage pressures, although that risk remained material. 38: The labour market was tight and domestic cost and price pressures remained elevated. While the Guarantee reduced inflation in the near term, it also meant that household spending was likely to be less weak than projected in the August Report over the first two years of the forecast period. All else equal and relative to that forecast, this would add to inflationary pressures in the medium term. 39: In view of these considerations, all members of the Committee judged that an increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. 40: All members also agreed that the forthcoming Growth Plan would provide further fiscal support and was likely to contain news that was material for the economic outlook. In the November MPC round, the Committee would make a full assessment of the impact on demand and inflation from all these announcements, along with other news, and determine further implications for monetary policy. 41: Five members judged that a further 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate to 2.25% was warranted at this meeting. For these members, a tight labour market with wage growth and domestic inflation well above target-consistent rates justified a further, forceful response from monetary policy. The impact of the Energy Price Guarantee meant that the pressure of demand relative to supply was likely to be stronger than previously expected. In the near term, the Guarantee would lower and bring forward the expected peak in CPI inflation. This should restrain expectations of above-target inflation further ahead, but was not necessarily sufficient to do so alone, given inflation would still be very high for several months. The November forecast round would provide the Committee with an opportunity to make a full assessment of the impact on demand and inflation of the Government’s fiscal announcements. 42: Three members preferred a 0.75 percentage point increase in Bank Rate to 2.5% at this meeting. For these members, recent data outturns had already registered more persistent inflationary pressures, and medium-term measures of inflation expectations had remained high. The Energy Price Guarantee, while welcome in its reduction of the near-term peak in inflation, would provide additional support to households, which would add to demand pressure. Faster policy tightening now would help to bring inflation back to the target sustainably in the medium term, and reduce the risks of a more extended and costly tightening cycle later. 43: One member preferred a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate to 2% at this meeting. For this member, recent data outturns had suggested that activity was already weakening, and the risks of second-round effects from near-term inflation were falling. On the latter, higher-than-expected services price inflation could reflect energy price or base effects in some sectors that would not persist, and wage growth across services sectors had been negatively correlated with producer price inflation in recent quarters. Set against that, there could be further pressures of demand on supply in the medium term, including from expected fiscal policy. On balance, for this member, an increase of 0.25 percentage points was appropriate at this time, although the member had also considered the case for an increase of 0.5 percentage points. 44: The MPC would take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. Policy was not on a pre-set path. The Committee would, as always, consider and decide the appropriate level of Bank Rate at each meeting. The scale, pace and timing of any further changes in Bank Rate would reflect the Committee’s assessment of the economic outlook and inflationary pressures. Should the outlook suggest more persistent inflationary pressures, including from stronger demand, the Committee would respond forcefully, as necessary. 45: Consistent with the guidance set out in the minutes of its August meeting, and given that economic and market conditions were judged appropriate, all members of the Committee agreed at this meeting that the Bank of England should reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by an amount of £80 billion over the next twelve months, comprising both maturing gilts and gilt sales, to a total of £758 billion. 46: The Committee reaffirmed that, as a matter of course, it would not continue to vote at each meeting on propositions regarding the stock of purchased assets outside a scheduled annual review. The Committee also reaffirmed that, as set out in the minutes of its August meeting, there would be a high bar for amending the planned reduction in the stock of purchased gilts outside such a review. In judging whether that bar was met, the Financial Policy Committee would also have a role through its assessment of financial stability. 47: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.5 percentage points, to 2.25%; The Bank of England should reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £80 billion over the next twelve months, to a total of £758 billion. 48: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Huw Pill, and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the first proposition. Three members (Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann and Dave Ramsden) voted against the first proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 0.75 percentage points, to 2.5%. One member (Swati Dhingra) voted against the first proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 2%. 49: The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the second proposition. Operational considerations 50: On 21 September 2022, the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) was £857 billion, comprising £838 billion of UK government bond purchases and £18.9 billion of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases. 51: In light of the revised timing of this MPC meeting, the Bank had announced on 9 September that sales of APF corporate bonds via auctions would start one week later than previously announced, with the first operation to take place on 27 September. The Bank would stand ready to conduct corporate bond buybacks during specified execution windows from the week beginning 24 October. 52: The details of the gilt sales programme voted on at this MPC meeting were set out in a Market Notice accompanying these minutes. These supplemented details set out in the Market Notice published by the Bank on 1 September, confirming the commencement of these operations and providing further detail on the precise timing and size of gilt sale operations in the quarter ahead. 53: Alongside these minutes, the Governor had exchanged letters with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, regarding the implications of the MPC’s decision at this meeting on gilt sales for various operational arrangements related to the APF. 54: The Committee had been briefed at its August meeting on operational changes to the Sterling Monetary Framework that would come into effect alongside the start of a gilt sales programme. The Bank would launch a new Short Term Repo (STR) facility to help to ensure that short-term market rates remained close to Bank Rate, and to allow the MPC to make future decisions about APF unwind independently of the implications for the supply of reserves. Details of the STR had been set out in a Market Notice on 1 September. The first operation would take place on 6 October, following the commencement of the gilt sales programme. 55: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Swati Dhingra Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Silvana Tenreyro Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Anne Glover was also present on 8 September, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in her role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 2 November will be published on 3 November 2022.

At its meeting ending on 2 November 2022, the MPC voted by a majority of 7-2 to increase Bank Rate by 0.75 percentage points, to 3%. One member preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 2.75%, and one member preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 2.5%. As set out in the accompanying November Monetary Policy Report, the MPC’s updated projections for activity and inflation describe a very challenging outlook for the UK economy. Since the MPC’s previous forecast, there have been significant developments in fiscal policy. Uncertainty around the outlook for UK retail energy prices has fallen to some extent following further government interventions. For the current November forecast, and consistent with the Government’s announcements on 17 October, the MPC’s working assumption is that some fiscal support continues beyond the current six-month period of the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG), generating a stylised path for household energy prices over the next two years. Such support would mechanically limit further increases in the energy component of CPI inflation significantly, and reduce its volatility. However, in boosting aggregate private demand relative to the August projections, the support could augment inflationary pressures in non-energy goods and services. Other fiscal measures announced up to and including 17 October also support demand relative to the August projection. The MPC’s forecast does not incorporate any further measures that may be announced in the Autumn Statement scheduled for 17 November. There have been large moves in UK asset prices since the August Report. These partly reflect global developments, although UK-specific factors have played a very significant role during this period. The MPC’s projections are conditioned on the path of Bank Rate implied by financial markets in the seven working days leading up to 25 October. That path rose to a peak of around 5¼% in 2023 Q3, before falling back. Overall, the path is around 2¼ percentage points higher over the next three years than in the August projection. The higher market yield curve has pushed new mortgage rates up sharply. Financial conditions have tightened materially, pushing down on activity over the forecast period. GDP is expected to decline by around ¾% during 2022 H2, in part reflecting the squeeze on real incomes from higher global energy and tradable goods prices. The fall in activity around the end of this year is expected to be less marked than in August, however, reflecting support from the EPG. The labour market remains tight, although there are signs that labour demand has begun to ease. CPI inflation was 10.1% in September and is projected to pick up to around 11% in 2022 Q4, lower than was expected in August, reflecting the impact of the EPG. Services CPI inflation has risen. Nominal annual private sector regular pay growth rose to 6.2% in the three months to August, 0.6 percentage points higher than expected in the August Report. In the MPC’s November central projection that is conditioned on the elevated path of market interest rates, GDP is projected to continue to fall throughout 2023 and 2024 H1, as high energy prices and materially tighter financial conditions weigh on spending. Four-quarter GDP growth picks up to around ¾% by the end of the projection. Although there is judged to be a significant margin of excess demand currently, continued weakness in spending is likely to lead to an increasing amount of economic slack emerging from the first half of next year, including a rising jobless rate. The LFS unemployment rate is expected to rise to just under 6½% by the end of the forecast period and aggregate slack increases to 3% of potential GDP. In the MPC’s central projection, CPI inflation starts to fall back from early next year as previous increases in energy prices drop out of the annual comparison. Domestic inflationary pressures remain strong in coming quarters and then subside. CPI inflation is projected to fall sharply to some way below the 2% target in two years’ time, and further below the target in three years’ time. In projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 3%, activity is stronger than in the MPC’s forecast conditioned on market rates, although GDP is still expected to be falling at the end of 2023. CPI inflation is projected to be a little above the target at the end of the second year. However, it falls more than a percentage point below the target at the end of the third year. The risks around both sets of inflation projections are judged to be skewed to the upside in the medium term, however, in part reflecting the possibility of more persistence in wage and price setting. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Monetary policy will ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continues, CPI inflation will return to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy is also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2% target. The labour market remains tight and there have been continuing signs of firmer inflation in domestic prices and wages that could indicate greater persistence. Currently announced fiscal policy, including the MPC’s working assumption about continued fiscal support for household energy prices, will also support demand, relative to the Committee’s projections in August. The Committee will take account of any additional information in the Government’s Autumn Statement at its December meeting and in its next forecast in February. In view of these considerations, the Committee has voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.75 percentage points, to 3%, at this meeting. The majority of the Committee judges that, should the economy evolve broadly in line with the latest Monetary Policy Report projections, further increases in Bank Rate may be required for a sustainable return of inflation to target, albeit to a peak lower than priced into financial markets. There are, however, considerable uncertainties around the outlook. The Committee continues to judge that, if the outlook suggests more persistent inflationary pressures, it will respond forcefully, as necessary. The MPC will take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. The Committee will, as always, consider and decide the appropriate level of Bank Rate at each meeting. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 2 November 2022 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the backdrop of its latest economic projections, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: UK-weighted global GDP growth was likely to have remained weak in 2022 Q3, growing at a similar pace to the preceding quarter, and with the latest indicators suggesting that this would continue in the near term. Global inflation remained elevated, driven by higher energy prices and tight labour markets, but supply-chain bottlenecks had eased somewhat. 3: GDP in the euro area had increased by 0.2% in 2022 Q3 according to the preliminary flash estimate, in line with market expectations and much weaker than the 0.8% growth reported in Q2. The slowdown had largely reflected the continuing squeeze on household real incomes due to high energy and food prices. Several European governments had announced a range of policy measures to address the impact of high energy prices on households and businesses. These were expected to support growth. 4: In the United States, according to the advance estimate, third-quarter GDP had risen by 0.6%, having fallen slightly in the previous two quarters. Growth had been boosted by net trade in particular, with a rise in both goods and services exports, and a fall in goods imports. Financial conditions in the United States had continued to tighten, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had tightened monetary policy in response to inflationary pressures. This had also contributed to a slowing in the US housing market. 5: The US dollar effective exchange rate had appreciated by over 10% since the start of the year. This could have had important implications for the global economy, particularly for non-China emerging market economies (NCEMEs), through its impact on global asset prices. Capital outflows from NCEMEs had, however, generally been relatively gradual, and many NCEME exchange rates had depreciated by less against the US dollar than some advanced economy currencies, in part due to a number of NCEME central banks having tightened monetary policy early and significantly, as well as some of these countries being commodity exporters. Nonetheless, this tightening in financial conditions implied a weakening in the outlook for NCEMEs. 6: Official Chinese GDP data suggested growth in 2022 Q3 had been stronger than expected, at 3.9%, as Covid-related restrictions were loosened. Accommodative monetary and fiscal policies had also boosted growth. The pickup in Q3 was in part a rebound from a 2.7% contraction recorded in Q2. Looking ahead, the ongoing impact of Covid-related restrictions, weakness in the housing sector and a slowing in global demand were expected to weigh on activity. 7: European gas spot prices had fallen markedly since their peak in August. At the time of this MPC meeting, the Dutch Title Transfer Facility spot price, a measure of European wholesale gas prices, was around €117 per MWh, around 40% lower than at the time of the previous meeting. This had been driven partly by the build-up of gas stocks in many European countries ahead of the winter. Gas futures prices remained elevated though, which reflected the ongoing impact of Russia’s restriction of gas supplies to Europe. 8: Global supply-chain bottlenecks had eased as supply conditions had improved and as global demand had slowed. Shipping costs had fallen from their peaks earlier in the year and other indicators of supply constraints pointed to an easing of pressures over the past few months. The Brent crude oil spot price was little changed from September, at $95 a barrel, although it remained 20% higher than at the start of the year. Metals prices had fallen slightly since September. Global agricultural goods prices were broadly unchanged, but had fallen by around 20% from their recent peaks in 2022 Q2. 9: Labour markets had remained tight in the United States and in the euro area. Vacancies were elevated relative to unemployment. In the United States, although this ratio, a summary measure of labour market tightness, had fallen back a little in recent months, it remained near record levels. Wage growth was elevated in both the United States and the euro area, although it had slowed somewhat in recent outturns in the United States. 10: According to the flash estimate, euro-area annual headline HICP inflation in October had increased to 10.7%, with energy prices continuing to be the key driver of high inflation. This was significantly higher than had been expected, with the contribution from energy accounting for the largest part of the surprise. In the United States, annual headline PCE inflation had fallen from its recent peak, to 6.2% in September, and annual US CPI inflation had fallen to 8.2%, reflecting the fall in oil and hence fuel prices. Services inflation had been higher in the United States than in the euro area, which had in part reflected greater labour market tightness. Monetary and financial conditions 11: The level of short and longer-term market interest rates in the United Kingdom were overall only modestly changed compared to the MPC’s September meeting, but were still substantially higher than at the time of the August Monetary Policy Report. In recent weeks, there had been a period of exceptional volatility in UK financial markets, with significant repricing of UK financial assets, particularly affecting long-dated UK government debt. Market interest rates had risen very sharply after the Government’s Growth Plan was announced on 23 September and had been volatile thereafter, before retracing. 12: On 28 September, following a period of volatility and market illiquidity, the Bank of England had announced a strictly time-limited and targeted financial stability operation to buy long-dated UK government bonds, in order to address market dysfunction and to reduce any risks to financial stability and core funding markets. On 10 and 11 October, the Bank had announced additional measures, including undertaking further targeted daily purchase operations for index-linked UK government bonds. In line with what the Bank had announced from the outset of these operations, all bond purchases had ceased on 14 October. These financial stability operations had been designed to allow liability-driven investment (LDI) funds affected by the significant repricing of UK financial assets time to reduce their leverage and to increase their resilience to future stresses. 13: In the days leading up to the MPC’s November meeting, conditions in UK financial markets had stabilised somewhat, leaving the overall moves in gilt yields since the MPC’s previous meeting relatively small. On balance, across major advanced economies, the near-term path for market-implied policy rates had not changed materially since the September meeting, but these paths and longer-term yields remained substantially higher than at the time of the August Report. Overall, moves since August had been largest in the United Kingdom, where ten-year government bond yields had risen by around 160 basis points, compared to around 130 basis points in the United States and euro area. Over this period, global equity prices had fallen and spreads on corporate debt had widened. These falls in risky asset prices had been somewhat more pronounced in the United Kingdom, relative to other major advanced economies. 14: Central banks in major advanced economies had continued to tighten monetary policy since the MPC’s September meeting and were expected by market participants to continue to react strongly to near-term inflationary pressures. At its meeting on 27 October, the ECB Governing Council had raised its key policy interest rates by 75 basis points, in line with prior market expectations and following an increase of 75 basis points at its September meeting. The Governing Council expected to raise interest rates further, while noting that substantial progress had been made in withdrawing monetary policy accommodation. The FOMC had also increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points at its September meeting to 3 to 3¼%, and market contacts expected a further increase of 75 basis points at the FOMC’s meeting ending on 2 November. 15: The median respondent to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected Bank Rate to be increased by 75 basis points at this meeting, broadly in line with the expected increase in Bank Rate derived from market pricing. 16: The MPC’s projections were conditioned on the path of Bank Rate implied by financial markets in the seven working days leading up to 25 October. That path was rising to a peak of around 5¼% in 2023 Q3, before falling back. In the immediate run-up to the MPC’s November meeting, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate peaked at around 4¾% in the second half of 2023, broadly in line with the peak at the time of the MPC’s September meeting. The expected path for Bank Rate in the latest MaPS, conducted between 19 and 21 October, had remained lower than the market-implied path but had shifted materially higher relative to the previous survey conducted at the start of September. The median expected path now had a peak in Bank Rate of 4½% in May 2023, 1 percentage point higher than the peak of 3½% in the previous survey. Thereafter, respondents expected a somewhat faster decline in Bank Rate than implied by the market path, with the median expectation for Bank Rate at the three-year horizon falling to 3%. 17: Recent changes in market expectations for the path of Bank Rate had followed substantial upward moves between the August and September meetings. In the United Kingdom, the market-implied path for policy rates was now on average around 2 percentage points higher over the next three years than at the time of the August Report. That rise had been larger than in the United States and euro area. According to market participants, the rise in UK rates since August had reflected a number of factors, including the impact of recent fiscal announcements on UK demand, a higher premium required to invest in UK assets, data news on the degree of near-term domestic inflationary pressures, global factors, market illiquidity, and perceptions of the central bank reaction function. 18: Market-implied measures of medium-term inflation compensation had risen somewhat in the United States and euro area since the MPC’s September meeting, but had remained within recent ranges. In the United Kingdom, medium-term inflation compensation measures had been very volatile and had fallen sharply since the MPC’s previous meeting. These moves had, however, been distorted by the volatile repricing in long-dated and index-linked UK government debt and associated pressure on LDI funds during that period. Respondents to the MaPS had provided an alternative gauge of inflation expectations among market participants. The median respondent’s expectation for CPI inflation had risen since the previous survey at both the three and five-year horizons, to 3% and 2.5% respectively. 19: In the immediate run-up to the MPC’s November meeting, the sterling effective exchange rate had been around 1¾% higher compared to the previous MPC meeting but had remained around 2¾% lower relative to the August meeting. Those relatively modest overall changes had masked volatile moves in the exchange rate during the recent period of market turbulence, with sterling briefly reaching an historic low against the dollar. Consistent with this, sterling implied volatility, a measure of the uncertainty around the outlook for the exchange rate, had picked up significantly, before falling back in the most recent data. Sterling risk reversal measures derived from foreign exchange options had also fallen sharply during the period of market volatility, suggesting that the price of insuring against the risk of a large depreciation in sterling significantly exceeded the price of insuring against a large appreciation. 20: Lending rates for new mortgages had increased sharply since the MPC’s previous meeting, reflecting the sharp rise in risk-free market rates during the period as well as increases since the August Report. The monthly average quoted rate on a two-year fixed-rate 75% loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage had increased from 3.6% in August, to 4.2% in September. Preliminary data suggested that the rate had increased significantly further to 6.0% in October, its highest rate since 2008. Rates had increased across all major LTV categories, with the pass-through of higher reference rates occurring faster than had typically been the case in the past. Reference rates had fallen back from their highs in late September, and there had been moderate falls in some mortgage rates in the days leading up to this MPC meeting. 21: During the period of volatility in UK interest rate markets, the number of available mortgage products across all LTVs had fallen sharply for a short period. The number of available products had since recovered somewhat, but remained below its previous level. Interest rates on some unsecured household borrowing products had also increased since the MPC’s September meeting. Lenders had reported in the latest Credit Conditions Survey (CCS), which had been carried out before the exceptional volatility in UK interest rate markets, that credit availability had declined in 2022 Q3 for both secured and unsecured household borrowing and that further declines were expected in Q4. 22: Bank lending rates to corporates had also increased in the latest data for September. Lenders responding to the Bank’s latest CCS had expected overall corporate credit availability to worsen in Q4 and more recent market intelligence also suggested that there had been a contraction in the availability of credit to corporates in recent weeks, particularly for riskier borrowers. 23: Deposit rates for both sight and term deposits had risen since the MPC’s September meeting. The rate on sight deposits had increased by 35 basis points while the rate on two-year fixed-rate bonds had increased by over 100 basis points. Household deposit flows had increased in September. Non-financial corporations had reduced their deposits, while financial corporations had increased their deposits materially, which was likely to reflect the significant market volatility towards the end of the month. Demand and output 24: UK quarterly GDP growth in 2022 Q2 had been revised up to 0.2% in the Quarterly National Accounts. Estimates of GDP had been revised lower in preceding quarters, such that the level of GDP in Q2 was now estimated to be slightly below its pre-Covid level. Downward revisions to past estimates of health output had more than offset upward revisions to market sector output. 25: Monthly GDP was estimated to have fallen by 0.3% in August, following a 0.1% increase in July. Bank staff now expected GDP to have contracted by 0.5% in 2022 Q3 as a whole, 0.9 percentage points weaker than anticipated in the August Monetary Policy Report. Although the expected weakness in part reflected the additional bank holiday for the Queen’s state funeral in September, it was primarily driven by weakness in underlying output. That underlying weakness was in part likely to be a reflection of the fall in real household incomes, and hence consumer spending, due to higher global energy and tradable goods prices. 26: Most business survey indicators had weakened since the MPC’s September meeting. For example, the S&P Global/CIPS UK PMI flash composite output index had fallen to 47.2 in October, below its long-run average and consistent with negative GDP growth. The future output index had also fallen significantly, from 61.4 in September to 55.0 in October. According to the Bank’s Agents, economic activity had continued to weaken, as squeezed real incomes and increased uncertainty about the outlook weighed on confidence and demand. Growth was also constrained by ongoing shortages of labour and goods, though to a lesser extent than previously. 27: Following 0.2% growth in 2022 Q2, household consumption growth was expected to fall in both Q3 and Q4. Retail sales volumes had fallen by 1.4% in September. This had continued the downward trend in retail spending observed since the second half of 2021, although the weakness in part reflected the additional bank holiday for the Queen’s state funeral. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported that the squeeze on real incomes was being felt across most areas of consumer spending. GfK consumer confidence had fallen to a new record-low level in September, and had remained close to that low in October, despite recovering a little. The September RICS survey pointed to continued weakness in housing demand and a wider set of survey indicators suggested that UK house price inflation had started to slow. 28: Business investment had been weak for some time and, despite increasing by 3.7% in 2022 Q2, was around 8% below its pre-Covid level. A range of evidence suggested that business investment was likely to remain subdued in the near term. For example, in the October Decision Maker Panel survey, uncertainty had remained elevated. Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents highlighted that this uncertainty, as well as rising costs, tighter financial conditions and increased working capital requirements, were weighing on companies’ investment plans. 29: The Government had announced a reversal of the 1.25 percentage point increase in the National Insurance contribution from 6 November 2022 and the cancellation of the Health and Social Care Levy, which had been due to come into force from 6 April 2023. It had also made changes to Stamp Duty Land Tax, doubling the nil rate band to £250,000 and increasing the level at which stamp duty started for first-time buyers from £300,000 to £425,000. The Government had also cancelled the planned 1 percentage point cut in the basic rate of income tax from April 2024, keeping it at 20% until economic conditions allowed for it to be cut. It had permanently set the Annual Investment Allowance at £1 million, rather than allowing it to fall in April 2023. 30: Overall, together with the government’s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) that had been announced prior to the MPC’s September meeting and subsequently adjusted, these measures were expected to support demand. A fuller plan for UK tax and spending was due to be published on 17 November in the Autumn Statement. Supply, costs and prices 31: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen to 3.5% in the three months to August, its lowest level since 1974. The vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, a measure of labour market tightness, had reached a new record high, as unemployment had fallen by more than the number of vacancies. The LFS inactivity rate had risen to around 1 percentage point above its pre-Covid level, with that increase largely accounted for by a greater proportion of people of working age who did not want a job, within which there had been an increase in long-term sickness. In contrast, the inactivity rate had fallen in the euro area since the onset of the pandemic, and had risen to a lesser extent in the United States. 32: There were signs that labour demand had begun to ease, although the labour market had remained tight. The number of vacancies had fallen somewhat further in September, and survey measures of employment intentions had also softened, albeit none were pointing to outright falls in employment. The latest KPMG/REC UK Report on Jobs had continued to show demand for staff rising, but at a slower rate, alongside low staff availability. A growing number of contacts of the Bank’s Agents had paused recruitment or were planning to allow headcount to fall through attrition, but most firms were reportedly reluctant to make any redundancies due to ongoing recruitment difficulties. 33: Indicators of nominal pay growth had remained strong, consistent with the effects of continued labour market tightness alongside higher inflation outturns and short-term inflation expectations. Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings growth had risen to a little above 6% in the three months to August, and to further above the August Monetary Policy Report projection. The Agents were reporting that pay settlements had stabilised at around 5% to 7%. Recruitment difficulties during the post-Covid recovery had led to more consumer-facing firms moving away from hourly pay rates that were aligned to the statutory National Living Wage and moving towards paying the voluntary UK real Living Wage, which had risen by around 10%. An increasing number of firms had also made, or were preparing to make, salary payments in addition to their normal pay round, including one-off payments to staff to try to help to offset rising living costs. 34: Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen slightly to 10.1% in September, reflecting a pickup across non-energy components. Food price inflation had increased to 14.5%, higher than had been expected ahead of the release, with offsetting news across other items. Core CPI inflation, excluding food, beverages, tobacco and energy, had risen a little to 6.5%. In aggregate, both CPI inflation and core CPI inflation had been broadly in line with the August Report forecast. 35: CPI inflation was expected to rise to almost 11% in October, as retail gas and electricity prices increased to levels consistent with the Government’s EPG. The Government had announced that the EPG would remain in place for six months, and that a Treasury-led review would consider how to support households with their energy bills after April 2023. The Government had also announced that this further support would be at a lower cost than if the EPG had remained at the same level for a full two years, while ensuring enough support for those in need. 36: Under the November Report short-term forecast, CPI inflation was projected to fall towards 10% in 2023 Q1. The projected decline was in part a reflection of strong price increases around the turn of this year beginning to fall out of the annual calculation. Survey indicators of costs and prices, such as the composite input and output price PMIs, had also tended to moderate in recent months, albeit they had remained elevated relative to their historical averages. Core goods CPI inflation was expected to fall amid signs of supply-chain pressures easing and demand weakening. Services CPI inflation was expected to remain close to recent rates of around 6%, however, in part due to continued pass-through of labour and other costs, including energy. 37: Business and household measures of inflation expectations had remained elevated, albeit that some indicators had ticked down more recently. Respondents to the Decision Maker Panel had lowered their own price expectations for the year ahead in October, with a modest narrowing of the upper tail of the distribution, and with a larger fall in their expectations for CPI inflation. The Citi/YouGov household measures of inflation expectations over the next year and next five-to-ten years ahead were broadly unchanged in October, having fallen in September from their record high levels in August. Professional forecasters responding to the Bank’s latest quarterly survey were projecting CPI inflation to be 2.4%, on average, in three years’ time. The immediate policy decision 38: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 39: Since the Committee’s September meeting, the most significant developments had been in fiscal policy, particularly regarding support for household energy prices, and in financial markets. 40: As regards fiscal policy, further government interventions had reduced uncertainty around the outlook for UK retail energy prices. For this forecast, and consistent with the announcements on 17 October, the MPC’s working assumption was that some fiscal support would continue beyond the current six-month period of the EPG, generating a stylised path for household energy prices over the next two years. Such support would mechanically limit further increases in the energy component of CPI inflation significantly, and reduce its volatility. However, in boosting aggregate private demand relative to the August projections, the support could augment inflationary pressures in non-energy goods and services. 41: Other fiscal measures that had been announced up to and including 17 October would also support demand relative to the August projection. The MPC’s forecast did not incorporate any further measures that might be announced in the Autumn Statement scheduled for 17 November. 42: There had been large moves in UK asset prices since the August Monetary Policy Report. These had partly reflected global developments, although UK-specific factors had played a very significant role during this period. The MPC’s projections were conditioned on the path of Bank Rate implied by financial markets in the seven working days leading up to 25 October. That path had risen to a peak of around 5¼% in 2023 Q3, before falling back. Overall, the path was around 2¼ percentage points higher over the next three years than in the August projection. The higher market yield curve had pushed new mortgage rates up sharply. Financial conditions had tightened materially, pushing down on activity over the forecast period. 43: In the immediate run-up to the MPC’s November meeting, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate had peaked at around 4¾%. 44: In response to the deterioration in market conditions in late September, the Bank of England had, following a recommendation from the Financial Policy Committee, announced temporary and targeted purchases of nominal and inflation-linked UK government bonds, of which the MPC had been informed at the time. The MPC had judged that these financial stability operations by the Bank would not affect the MPC’s ability to conduct monetary policy, including its earlier decision to sell UK government bonds. These gilt sales had begun on 1 November. 45: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, monthly GDP had been estimated to have fallen by 0.3% in August and most business survey indicators had weakened. Retail sales volumes had declined in September and GfK consumer confidence, which had fallen to a new record-low in September, had remained close to that level in October, despite recovering a little. The labour market had remained tight, although there were signs that labour demand had begun to ease. Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings growth had risen to a little above 6% in the three months to August, and to further above the August Report projection. CPI inflation had been 10.1% in September. Services CPI inflation had risen. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported that inflation was becoming a more important factor in pay negotiations, and that forthcoming increases in the National Living Wage were expected by some to influence pay negotiations. 46: The MPC’s latest projections described a very challenging outlook for the UK economy. It was expected to be in recession for a prolonged period and CPI inflation would remain elevated at over 10% in the near term. From mid-2023, inflation was expected to fall sharply, conditioned on the elevated path of market interest rates, and as previous increases in energy prices dropped out of the annual comparison. It was then expected to decline to some way below the 2% target in years two and three of the projection. This reflected a negative contribution from energy prices, as well as the emergence of an increasing degree of economic slack and a steadily rising unemployment rate. The risks around that declining path for inflation were judged to be to the upside. 47: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy had been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Monetary policy would ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continued, CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. 48: All members of the Committee judged that an increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. 49: Seven members judged that a 0.75 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 3%, was warranted at this meeting. For these members, with the labour market remaining tight, and cost and price pressures being elevated, a further, more forceful response from monetary policy was justified. There had been continuing signs of firmer inflation in domestic prices and wages that could indicate greater persistence. Announced fiscal policy, including the MPC’s working assumption about continued fiscal support for household energy prices, would also support demand, relative to the Committee’s projections in August. Overall, a larger increase in Bank Rate at this meeting would help to bring inflation back to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, and to reduce the risks of a more extended and costly tightening later. 50: One member preferred a 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 2.75%, at this meeting. GDP growth had been slowing and was now in negative territory. Nominal retail sales and services output had fallen. At the same time, there had been some wage growth, but real wages had fallen through the course of the year. The clearer signs of the cost of living crisis taking hold on economic activity suggested a more gradated approach was warranted to avoid an overtightening in policy. The lags in the effects of monetary policy implied that sizable impacts from past rate increases were still to come through. The continued risks from volatility and geopolitical uncertainty necessitated some tightening. But these risks also made it harder to take stock of the current situation and a smaller rate increase was warranted to safeguard against creating a deeper and longer recession. 51: One member preferred a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 2.5%, at this meeting. Monetary policy had already been restrictive in light of falling real incomes, with the economy now likely to be entering recession. Importantly, most of the tightening in policy over the past year was yet to feed through to the real economy. In line with estimated transmission lags, the prevailing level of Bank Rate would, in time, result in a looser labour market and lower domestic inflationary pressures, such that medium-term inflation was likely to fall below target. However, there remained uncertainty over the size of second-round effects from high headline inflation, and over how far and how quickly the labour market would respond to the slowing in demand. This member therefore felt that a further gradual tightening was warranted on risk management grounds, albeit that these grounds were becoming weaker as the policy stance became more restrictive. 52: The majority of the Committee judged that, should the economy evolve broadly in line with the latest Monetary Policy Report projections, further increases in Bank Rate might be required for a sustainable return of inflation to target, albeit to a peak lower than priced into financial markets. 53: There were, however, considerable uncertainties around the outlook. The Committee continued to judge that, if the outlook suggested more persistent inflationary pressures, it would respond forcefully, as necessary. 54: The MPC would take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. The Committee would, as always, consider and decide the appropriate level of Bank Rate at each meeting. 55: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.75 percentage points, to 3%. 56: Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Two members voted against the proposition. Swati Dhingra preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 2.75%, and Silvana Tenreyro preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 2.5%. Operational considerations 57: At its September 2022 meeting, the MPC had voted to begin sales of UK government bonds. On 28 September, the Bank’s Executive had postponed the start of these gilt sale operations, in light of the dysfunctional market conditions at that time. In a Market Notice published on 20 October, the Bank had announced that, for 2022 Q4, gilt sale operations would be distributed evenly across the short and medium maturity sectors only. The first gilt sale operation, of £750 million, had taken place on 1 November. 58: The first operation in the corporate bond sales programme had taken place on 27 September. On 11 October, in light of the dysfunctional market conditions at that time, the Bank had temporarily paused its corporate bond sales operations for two weeks. Sales had restarted on 25 October. 59: On 2 November 2022, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £854 billion, comprising £837 billion of UK government bond purchases and £17.4 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases. 60: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Swati Dhingra Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Silvana Tenreyro Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. 61: As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, David Roberts was also present on 26 and 28 October, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 14 December will be published on 15 December 2022.

At its meeting ending on 14 December 2022, the MPC voted by a majority of 6-3 to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 3.5%. Two members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 3%, and one member preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.75 percentage points, to 3.75%. In the MPC’s November Monetary Policy Report projections, conditioned on the elevated path of market interest rates at that time, the UK economy was expected to be in recession for a prolonged period and CPI inflation was expected to remain very high in the near term. Inflation was expected to fall sharply from mid-2023, to some way below the 2% target in years two and three of the projection. This reflected a negative contribution from energy prices, as well as the emergence of an increasing degree of economic slack and a steadily rising unemployment rate. The risks around that declining path for inflation were judged to be to the upside. Domestic wage and price pressures are elevated. There has been limited news in other domestic and global economic data relative to the November Report projections. Most indicators of global supply chain bottlenecks have eased, but global inflationary pressures remain elevated. Advanced-economy government bond yields have fallen, particularly at longer maturities. The sterling effective exchange rate has appreciated by around 2¾%. There has been some reduction in UK fixed-term mortgage rates since the Committee’s previous meeting, but rates remain materially higher than in the summer. Bank staff now expect UK GDP to decline by 0.1% in 2022 Q4, 0.2 percentage points stronger than expected in the November Report. Household consumption remains weak and most housing market indicators have continued to soften. Surveys of investment intentions have also weakened further. Although labour demand has begun to ease, the labour market remains tight. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.7% in the three months to October. Vacancies have fallen back, but the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio remains at a very elevated level. Annual growth of private sector regular pay picked up further in the three months to October, to 6.9%, 0.5 percentage points stronger than the expectation at the time of the November Report. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell from 11.1% in October to 10.7% in November. The November figure was slightly below expectations at the time of the November Report. The exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer is being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Although the introduction of the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) in October has limited the rise in CPI inflation, the contribution of household energy bills to inflation has risen further. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, core goods price inflation has fallen back, while annual food and services price inflation have strengthened. CPI inflation is expected to continue to fall gradually over the first quarter of 2023, as earlier increases in energy and other goods prices drop out of the annual comparison. The announcement in the Autumn Statement that the extension of the EPG will cap household unit energy prices at a level consistent with a typical household dual fuel bill of £3,000 per year from April 2023 to March 2024 implies a slightly lower near-term path for energy bills than the working assumption made in the November Report. All else equal, this will reduce the MPC’s forecast for CPI inflation in 2023 Q2 by around ¾ of a percentage point. Other additional near-term fiscal support was also announced in the Autumn Statement, but fiscal policy is expected to tighten by progressively larger amounts from fiscal year 2024-25 onwards. Overall, Bank staff estimate that these measures, combined with the impact of the EPG, will increase the level of GDP by 0.4% at a one-year horizon, leave it broadly unchanged at a two-year horizon, but reduce the level of GDP by 0.5% in three years’ time, relative to what was assumed in the November Report. The overall impact on the CPI inflation projection at all of these horizons is estimated to be small. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Monetary policy will ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continues, CPI inflation will return to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy is also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2% target. The Committee has voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 3.5%, at this meeting. The labour market remains tight and there has been evidence of inflationary pressures in domestic prices and wages that could indicate greater persistence and thus justifies a further forceful monetary policy response. The majority of the Committee judges that, should the economy evolve broadly in line with the November Monetary Policy Report projections, further increases in Bank Rate may be required for a sustainable return of inflation to target. There are considerable uncertainties around the outlook. The Committee continues to judge that, if the outlook suggests more persistent inflationary pressures, it will respond forcefully, as necessary. The MPC will take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. The Committee will, as always, consider and decide the appropriate level of Bank Rate at each meeting. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 14 December 2022 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: UK-weighted world GDP had increased by 0.5% in 2022 Q3, stronger than had been expected in the November Monetary Policy Report, and was expected to increase by 0.1% in Q4, in line with the projection in the November Report. Most measures of global supply chain bottlenecks had eased, but global inflationary pressures had remained elevated. 3: In the euro area, GDP had increased by 0.3% in 2022 Q3, stronger than incorporated into the November Report but weaker than the 0.8% growth in Q2. Bank staff expected GDP to fall by 0.2% in the fourth quarter, a little weaker than had been anticipated in the November Report. The composite output PMI had increased slightly in November but had remained in contractionary territory for the fifth month in a row. The weakness had been broad based across euro-area economies and across sectors. 4: In the United States, GDP had increased by 0.7% in 2022 Q3, stronger than had been expected in the November Report. The share of services in consumption had risen throughout the third quarter, tentatively pointing to the expected rotation in US demand, although this had partly reversed in October. In the fourth quarter, US GDP was expected to rise by 0.1%, broadly in line with the expectation in the November Report. Non-farm payrolls had increased by 263,000 in November and the unemployment rate had remained unchanged at 3.7%. 5: In China, a sharp increase in Covid cases had contributed to a slowing in activity. China’s quarterly GDP growth in 2022 Q4 was likely to be some way below the 1.4% rate that had been anticipated at the time of the November Report. Covid outbreaks and related restrictions had weighed on consumption, and import growth had contracted sharply as a result. Chinese export growth had also contracted in November, reflecting slowing global growth and some Covid-related disruption to production. The Chinese government had issued new guidelines recently that had eased some zero-Covid policies. The weakening property sector had continued to have a negative impact on activity. 6: Most measures of global supply chain constraints had eased in recent months, broadly in line with the assumption in the November Report. This was evident in the movements in October and November of an indicator of supply constraints based on global PMI surveys, although that indicator had remained elevated compared with historical averages. In China, that measure had increased in October and November, but had remained below recent peaks and around its historical average. Shipping costs had fallen across a number of regions. Further Covid outbreaks and any associated disruption to output in China could pose a risk to global supply chains in future, although the precise effect would depend on the Chinese economy’s response to changes in Covid policies and the extent to which global supply chains had become more resilient. 7: Energy price movements had been mixed since the MPC’s previous meeting. At the time of the December MPC meeting, the Brent crude oil spot price was around $80 a barrel, having fallen by around 15%, although only to around the same level as at the start of the year. The Dutch Title Transfer Facility spot price, a measure of European wholesale gas prices, was €137 per MWh, up 18% since the previous MPC meeting. Gas futures prices had remained elevated, reflecting concerns around the impact of Russian restrictions to gas supplies and an expectation that supply constraints would continue into next winter. Global agricultural goods prices were broadly unchanged over this period and compared to a year ago, though remained at elevated levels 8: According to the flash estimate, euro-area annual HICP inflation had fallen from 10.6% in October to 10.0% in November, with core HICP inflation remaining at 5.0%. US CPI inflation had fallen from 7.7% in October to 7.1% in November, suggesting PCE inflation would also ease further. 9: The MPC discussed the outlook for global inflation. In the November Report, world export price inflation had been expected to peak at 14% in 2022 Q2, and UK-weighted world consumer price inflation to peak at just over 8% in 2022 Q4. Developments since then had been consistent with that view. World export prices had been projected to fall over 2023 as a whole and global consumer price inflation was expected to decline to 1.9% by the end of next year. Absent further shocks, the assumed future path of energy prices and the easing of global supply constraints were consistent with this fall in global traded goods prices. Services price inflation in advanced economies could fall back more quickly than expected if its recent strength had in part reflected indirect effects of energy prices. The tightening in monetary policy across many economies would bear down on global demand and inflation, as the effects of increases in policy rates fed through with a lag. Further shocks to energy and other commodity prices continued to present some upside risks to the central outlook, as would more persistent tightness in advanced economy labour markets. In addition, there could be upside risks to services price inflation if persistently high input costs became embedded, including through higher wage growth. Monetary and financial conditions 10: Since the MPC’s November meeting, government bond yields had moved lower across major advanced economies, particularly at longer maturities. Ten-year yields had fallen by around 20, 60 and 20 basis points in the United Kingdom, United States and Germany respectively. Those movements had only partially offset the significantly larger increases in global yields that had occurred since the end of July. Supported by the recent reduction in yields, risky asset prices had risen globally since the MPC’s previous meeting. 11: Market expectations for the near-term path of policy rates were little changed across major advanced economies since the MPC’s previous meeting. Both the Federal Open Market Committee and the ECB Governing Council were expected to raise policy rates by 50 basis points at their forthcoming meetings concluding on 14 and 15 December respectively. The market-implied policy paths in the United States and euro area were expected to peak around the middle of next year at a little under 5% and a little under 3% respectively, not materially changed from at the time of the MPC’s previous meeting. 12: A large majority of respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected Bank Rate to be increased by 50 basis points at this MPC meeting, consistent with market-implied pricing. The median MaPS respondent expected Bank Rate to peak at 4¼% in the first half of next year and remain at that level throughout the remainder of 2023. The market-implied path for Bank Rate, which would also reflect any upside skew in Bank Rate expectations, rose to around 4¾% by around the middle of next year and remained close to that level throughout the remainder of 2023. While the market-implied path was a little higher than the MaPS median, the gap between these measures had narrowed since the previous MaPS survey, conducted in mid-October. 13: Further out, market-implied policy paths had fallen across major advanced economies since the MPC’s November meeting. Expectations for policy rates three years ahead, had declined by around 50, 75 and 40 basis points in the United Kingdom, United States and euro area respectively. In the United Kingdom, this was in addition to the material reduction that had occurred in the immediate run-up to the MPC’s November meeting, after the November Monetary Policy Report projections had been finalised. Nevertheless, expected rates at the three-year horizon had remained higher in the United Kingdom than in other major advanced economies. 14: Medium-term inflation compensation measures were little changed in the United States and euro area since the MPC’s previous meeting. Interpreting the moves in UK medium-term inflation compensation measures remained challenging. Nevertheless, these measures had fallen since the MPC’s previous meeting, following significant volatility in September and October, when there had been large distortions from the repricing in long-dated and index-linked UK government debt, and associated pressure on liability-driven investment (LDI) funds. Looking further back, there had been a material reduction in UK medium-term inflation compensation measures since their peak in March, although they had remained above their average levels of the past decade. In the latest MaPS, the median respondent’s expectation for CPI inflation at both the three and five-year horizons had been 2%, having fallen since the previous survey. Responses, however, had remained skewed to the upside. 15: The sterling effective exchange rate had appreciated by around 2¾% since the previous MPC meeting. In part, that had reflected a broad-based depreciation of the US dollar, consistent with the somewhat larger declines in US interest rate expectations relative to other advanced economies over the period and some improvement in global risk sentiment. 16: There had been some reduction in UK owner-occupied fixed-term mortgage rates since the Committee’s previous meeting, but rates had remained materially higher than in the summer. Lending rates for new fixed-rate mortgages had fallen by around 40 to 80 basis points since the November MPC meeting, reflecting the reduction in risk-free market rates following their sharp rise in late September around the time of the announcement of the Government’s Growth Plan. The number of mortgage products available had continued to recover from October lows, but had remained below the levels seen in the summer. 17: Over the past year, overall bank credit availability had reduced. According to supervisory intelligence that had, in large part, been related to an expected deterioration in borrowers’ balance sheets. 18: There were some early signs that tighter lending conditions and a decline in credit demand were feeding through to lower lending volumes. In the mortgage market, approvals for house purchase had fallen below 60,000 in October, which, excluding the Covid lockdown period in the first half of 2020, had been the lowest level since 2013. In the corporate sector, net finance raised by businesses in October had declined to its lowest level since 2009. 19: There had been a net reduction in sterling broad money in October, although that had only partially offset the very large increase in September. Sterling net lending had also fallen in October following a sizeable increase in September. These flows were accounted for primarily by some firms in the financial sector and one contributory factor was likely to have been the significant market volatility towards the end of September, associated with developments at LDI funds. 20: The MPC had been informed that, on 29 November, the Bank had begun to unwind, in a timely but orderly way, the specific gilt purchases resulting from the financial stability operations conducted between 28 September and 14 October. As of 13 December, around 40% of the gilts purchased during those operations had been sold. Demand and output 21: According to the ONS’s first quarterly estimate, GDP had fallen by 0.2% in 2022 Q3, a smaller decline than the expectation in the November Monetary Policy Report of a 0.5% fall. Within the expenditure components, household consumption and business investment had both fallen by 0.5%, while government spending was estimated to have risen by 2.1%. Underlying output, defined as market sector output adjusted for the estimated effects of recent additional bank holidays, was estimated by Bank staff to have fallen by a similar amount as headline GDP. 22: Monthly GDP had risen by 0.5% in October, following a 0.6% fall in September, and marginally stronger than had been expected by Bank staff immediately prior to the release. The rebound in the level of output had in large part reflected the unwind of the economic impact of the additional bank holiday for the Queen’s state funeral. At a sectoral level, private sector services had risen in line with expectations, with upside news concentrated in manufacturing output and, to a lesser degree, the government and construction sectors. 23: Bank staff now expected GDP to decline by 0.1% in 2022 Q4, 0.2 percentage points stronger than had been expected in the November Report. This was consistent with a weakening in quarterly underlying growth to between -¼% and -½%, partially offset by the boost to headline output growth from the effect of the additional bank holiday unwinding in October and an assumption that government output would contribute positively to GDP during the quarter. The S&P Global/CIPS UK composite output PMI had remained below the 50 no-change mark for the fourth consecutive month in November. Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents was consistent with only a modest further weakening in activity in the fourth quarter, centred in consumer-facing sectors. 24: For growth prospects further ahead, the composite future output PMI had recovered to close to its September levels, albeit remaining below its long-run average. In contrast, the CBI composite expectations balance had fallen sharply in November. An aggregate estimate of real growth from the latest Decision Maker Panel suggested that respondents expected sales volumes to stagnate over the next year. Taken together, the forward-looking survey evidence was broadly consistent with the projection in the November Report of a slight fall in GDP in 2023 Q1. 25: Indicators of household consumption had remained weak. Retail sales volumes had risen by 0.6% in October, in part reflecting the boost to growth from the effect of the additional bank holiday unwinding, but had remained 1.2% below their 2019 Q4 level. GfK consumer confidence had edged higher in November, but had remained very weak by historical standards. Household real incomes were expected to be broadly flat in the near term. 26: Most housing market indicators had continued to weaken in recent months, after several years of strength. Although the official UK House Price Index had increased strongly in October, house prices had fallen quite sharply in the Nationwide and Halifax indices in October and November. The November RICS survey had shown further declines in price balances and continuing weakness in indicators of housing market activity. According to higher-frequency Zoopla data, the volume of offers made on properties by potential buyers had declined to below their normal seasonal levels. 27: Surveys of investment intentions had weakened further, and were consistent with small declines in business investment, following a period of greater strength in capital spending after the worst of the pandemic. Agency intelligence indicated that business confidence had remained weak, although mentions of uncertainty in the Agents’ reports had fallen back somewhat in recent weeks. 28: The Autumn Statement had taken place on 17 November, accompanied by both an Economic and fiscal outlook from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and new fiscal rules as set out in an updated Charter for Budget Responsibility. Some additional fiscal support had been announced in the near term, including targeted cost-of-living support in addition to the extended Energy Price Guarantee scheme, cuts in business rates, and increased spending on health, social care and education. From fiscal year 2024-25, planned fiscal policy would tighten by progressively larger amounts, with net tax rises accounting for around half of this tightening and reductions in both departmental current and capital spending accounting for the other half. Overall, Bank staff estimated that the additional policy measures announced in the Autumn Statement could, relative to what had been assumed in the November Monetary Policy Report, increase the level of GDP by 0.4% in one year’s time, leave it broadly unchanged at a two-year horizon, but reduce the level of GDP by 0.5% in three years’ time. 29: The Committee discussed how the OBR’s latest macroeconomic projections compared to those in the November Monetary Policy Report. The OBR’s GDP projection was broadly similar to the MPC’s over the first year of the forecast period. Thereafter, the forecast profiles diverged very significantly, with the OBR expecting GDP to be around 5% higher than in the November Report by 2025 Q4. This gap reflected the OBR’s judgement that both demand and supply would be stronger than the MPC was expecting in the medium term. Productivity was expected to be around 1½% higher in the OBR’s projection, with that difference in part reflecting a much stronger projected path for business investment and hence the capital stock. Supply, costs and prices 30: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had risen to 3.7% in the three months to October, slightly higher than the expectation of 3.5% at the time of the November Monetary Policy Report. LFS employment had grown by 0.1% in the three months to October, slightly weaker than the 0.3% expected at the time of the November Report. HMRC employee payrolls had increased by 107,000 in November. LFS inactivity had fallen slightly, but had remained high by historical standards. 31: Regarding more forward-looking indicators, the KPMG/REC Report on Jobs for November had shown that hiring had remained below historical averages. The ONS vacancy survey had continued to decline in recent months, while remaining at a very high level. The vacancies–to-unemployment ratio had remained close to record highs, based on comparable series since 2001. Online indicators of vacancies had flattened off in recent months, but they had remained significantly above pre-Covid levels. Planned redundancies had remained low, although there had been a decrease in the S&P Global UK Household Financial Index and YouGov survey measures of perceptions of job security. Intelligence from contacts of the Bank’s Agents was consistent with some early signs of the labour market loosening, albeit from a very tight starting point, as employment intentions were flat and recruitment difficulties had eased slightly. 32: The Committee discussed recent labour market developments. Overall, recent data suggested that the labour market was historically very tight but appeared to be past its peak tightness. Labour demand appeared to have weakened somewhat and the November Report was consistent with a further weakening, given the usual lags between GDP and the labour market. While the earlier strength in the labour market had partly reflected the recovery in demand following the pandemic, recent weakness in labour participation appeared to have somewhat exacerbated the tightness of the labour market. This weakness in participation in part reflected an ageing population, early retirement decisions for some workers and ill health. Given that these trends could continue for some time, a key uncertainty was the speed of the downward adjustment to labour demand as labour supply fell, and thus the extent to which any supply-demand imbalance exerted upward pressure on inflation. The MPC would have an opportunity to review these judgements as part of its annual supply stocktake, which would conclude alongside the February 2023 Monetary Policy Report. 33: Annual whole-economy total pay growth had picked up slightly to 6.2% in the three months to October. Private sector regular pay growth had also picked up further to 6.9%, 0.5 percentage points stronger than the expectation at the time of the November Report. On a three month on three month annualised basis, private sector regular pay growth had fallen back to 6.7%, a level more in line with the annual rate of increase than earlier in the year. Annual public sector pay growth had remained weaker, at 2.7% in the three months to October. 34: Annual private sector wage growth was expected to flatten off at around 7% in coming months, before declining later in 2023. There were risks on either side. Pay indicators in the November KPMG/REC survey, which tended to lead the official data, had weakened a little further. However, a number of contacts of the Bank’s Agents expected further upward pressure on pay growth next year, in part as strength in CPI inflation could encourage workers to continue to demand high pay settlements. Some contacts had nevertheless reported that weaker demand, affordability constraints for firms and an easing in recruitment difficulties could limit the extent of pay increases. 35: Twelve-month consumer price inflation had fallen to 10.7% in November, from 11.1% in October. The November figure had been slightly lower than expected in the November Report, with the downside news concentrated in food and core goods prices. This release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. Core CPI inflation, excluding energy, food, beverages and tobacco, had eased slightly from 6.5% in October to 6.3% in November. 36: Considering non-energy inflationary pressures, core goods inflation had fallen back from recent peaks, in part due to weaker vehicle price inflation and was expected to ease further in the near term. This was consistent with an easing of supply chain bottlenecks and some cost pressures softening. However, food and non-alcoholic beverage price inflation had been 16.4% in November, its highest level in 45 years, and was expected to rise further. This had in large part reflected global factors including adverse climate conditions, supply constraints caused by the war in Ukraine and rising energy and fertiliser costs in food production. Core services inflation had risen to 6.3% in October and to 6.4% in November. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents reported that consumer services prices continue to be pushed up by higher input prices, particularly pay, food and energy. 37: The largest component of the overshoot of the 2% inflation target had continued to be the contribution from energy prices. CPI inflation was expected to stay elevated in the near term, but to continue to fall gradually over the first quarter of 2023, in large part as earlier increases in energy and other goods prices dropped out of the annual comparison. These effects were expected to outweigh continuing strength from food and services price inflation. 38: Since the November Report, the Government had announced that the cap on household unit energy prices under the Energy Price Guarantee would rise, from April 2023 to March 2024, to a level consistent with a typical annual dual-fuel bill of £3,000, from £2,500. Over the early part of the MPC’s forecast period, this implied a lower path for household energy bills than the working assumption made in the November Report of an indicative path for household utility bills that sat halfway between the previously announced £2,500 cap on the typical household bill and the level implied by futures prices under the Ofgem price cap framework. This downside news would lower the forecast for CPI inflation in 2023 Q2 by 0.8 percentage points, all else equal, and would boost household real incomes to a similar degree. 39: Most measures of households’ and businesses’ inflation expectations had fallen back in the latest data, but had remained at elevated levels. The one-year ahead Citi and Bank/Ipsos household measures had both fallen in November. At longer horizons, the five- to ten-year ahead Citi measure had fallen, while the Bank/Ipsos measure had risen a little. Respondents to the Decision Maker Panel in November had indicated lower own-price and inflation expectations over the next year, and lower inflation expectations three years ahead, although all of these series had remained above 2%. The immediate policy decision 40: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 41: In the MPC’s November Monetary Policy Report projections, conditioned on the elevated path of market interest rates at that time, the UK economy had been expected to be in recession for a prolonged period and CPI inflation had been expected to remain very high in the near term. Inflation had been expected to fall sharply from mid-2023, to some way below the 2% target in years two and three of the projection. This had reflected a negative contribution from energy prices, as well as the emergence of an increasing degree of economic slack and a steadily rising unemployment rate. The risks around that declining path for inflation had been judged to be to the upside. 42: Domestic wage and price pressures were elevated. There had been limited news in other domestic and global economic data relative to the November Report projections. Bank staff now expected UK GDP to decline by 0.1% in 2022 Q4, 0.2 percentage points stronger than had been expected in the November Report. Most housing market indicators had continued to weaken. Vacancies had fallen back, but the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio had remained at a very elevated level. Annual growth of private sector regular pay had picked up further and had been 0.5 percentage points stronger than had been expected at the time of the November Report. A number of contacts of the Bank’s Agents expected further upward pressure on pay growth next year, although pay indicators in the KPMG/REC survey, which tended to lead the official data, had weakened a little further. Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 10.7% in November, slightly below expectations at the time of the November Report. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, core goods price inflation had fallen back, while annual food and services price inflation had strengthened. Most measures of households’ and businesses’ inflation expectations had fallen back, but had remained at elevated levels. 43: The Autumn Statement had taken place on 17 November, accompanied by an Economic and fiscal outlook from the Office for Budget Responsibility and new fiscal rules as set out in an updated Charter for Budget Responsibility. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had also written to the Governor setting out the remit for the MPC, including some updates to the government’s economic strategy. In this letter, the Chancellor had stated that, although the Bank of England Act required him to reaffirm the MPC’s remit annually, to provide certainty he could confirm that this government would not change the definition of price stability. 44: The announcement in the Autumn Statement that the extension of the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) would cap household unit energy prices at a level consistent with a typical household dual fuel bill of £3,000 per year from April 2023 to March 2024 implied a slightly lower near-term path for energy bills than the working assumption made in the November Report. All else equal, this would reduce the MPC’s forecast for CPI inflation in 2023 Q2 by around ¾ of a percentage point. 45: Other additional near-term fiscal support had also been announced in the Autumn Statement, but fiscal policy was expected to tighten by progressively larger amounts from fiscal year 2024-25 onwards. Overall, Bank staff estimated that these measures, combined with the impact of the EPG, would increase the level of GDP by 0.4% at a one-year horizon, leave it broadly unchanged at a two-year horizon, but reduce the level of GDP by 0.5% in three years’ time, relative to what had been assumed in the November Report. The overall impact on the CPI inflation projection at all of these horizons was estimated to be small. 46: The Committee would make a fuller assessment of this news, taken together with other developments since the November Report, as part of its forthcoming forecast discussions ahead of the February MPC meeting. The MPC would also have an opportunity to review its judgements on the supply side of the economy as part of its annual supply stocktake, which would conclude alongside the February Monetary Policy Report. 47: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy had been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Monetary policy would ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continued, CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. 48: Six members of the Committee judged that a 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 3.5%, was warranted at this meeting. The labour market remained tight and there had been evidence of inflationary pressures in domestic prices and wages that could indicate greater persistence and thus justified a further forceful monetary policy response. Both services price inflation and private sector regular wage growth had increased significantly over the second half of the year, with the latter continuing to surprise on the upside since the November Report. There remained a risk that, following a protracted period of high inflation, inflation expectations could be slow to adjust downwards to target-consistent levels once external cost pressures had passed. Although activity in the economy was clearly weakening, there were some signs that it was more resilient than had been expected and it was therefore uncertain how quickly the labour market would loosen. Other economic forecasters had also continued to predict a stronger outlook for demand than in the MPC’s November Report projections. A 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate at this meeting would help to bring inflation back to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, and to reduce the risks of a more extended and costly tightening later. 49: Two members preferred to leave Bank Rate unchanged at 3% at this meeting. The real economy remained weak, as a result of falling real incomes and tighter financial conditions. There were increasing signs that the downturn was starting to affect the labour market. But the lags in the effects of monetary policy meant that sizeable impacts from past rate increases were still to come through. That implied the current setting of Bank Rate was more than sufficient to bring inflation back to target, before falling below target in the medium term. As the policy setting had become increasingly restrictive, there was no longer a strong case for further tightening on risk management grounds. 50: One member preferred a 0.75 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 3.75%, at this meeting. Although there was some evidence of an inflection point in CPI inflation, there was greater evidence that price and wage pressures would stay strong for longer than had been projected in the November Report. Another more forceful monetary tightening now would reinforce the tightening cycle, importantly leaning against an inflation psychology that was embedding in wage settlements and inflation expectations, and was pushing up core services and other underlying inflation measures. Pulling forward monetary action now would reduce the risk that Bank Rate would need to rise well into next year even as the economy slowed further. 51: The majority of the Committee judged that, should the economy evolve broadly in line with the November Monetary Policy Report projections, further increases in Bank Rate might be required for a sustainable return of inflation to target. 52: There were considerable uncertainties around the outlook. The Committee continued to judge that, if the outlook suggested more persistent inflationary pressures, it would respond forcefully, as necessary. 53: The MPC would take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. The Committee would, as always, consider and decide the appropriate level of Bank Rate at each meeting. 54: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.5 percentage points, to 3.5%. 55: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members voted against the proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Silvana Tenreyro) preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 3%. Catherine L Mann preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.75 percentage points, to 3.75%. Operational considerations 56: On 14 December 2022, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £844 billion, comprising £831 billion of UK government bond purchases and £13.6 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases. 57: At its September 2022 meeting, the MPC had voted to begin sales of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes. In 2022 Q4, the Bank had completed a total of £6 billion of sales of these bonds via eight auctions. Taken together with maturing bonds, this had led to a reduction in the outstanding stock of £7 billion in 2022 Q4 and £44 billion over 2022 as a whole. The MPC had been briefed on progress on these gilt sales and on the operational arrangements for 2023 Q1, which would be published in a Market Notice on 16 December at 6pm. 58: In February 2022, the MPC had voted to unwind fully the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases no earlier than towards the end of 2023. The stock of corporate bonds had since been reduced by a total of £6.4 billion, including £4.2 billion via sales through the Bank’s auctions since September. The Committee was content with the current rate of reduction in the stock, which, if sustained, would permit an earlier unwind of the portfolio than initially anticipated. The Committee would keep the pace of sales, and the implications for the completion date, under review. 59: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Swati Dhingra Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Silvana Tenreyro Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. 60: As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, David Roberts was also present on 7 and 9 December, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 1 February will be published on 2 February 2023.

At its meeting ending on 1 February 2023, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 4%. Two members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 3.5%. Global consumer price inflation remains high, although it is likely to have peaked across many advanced economies, including in the United Kingdom. Wholesale gas prices have fallen recently and global supply chain disruption appears to have eased amid a slowing in global demand. Many central banks have continued to tighten monetary policy, although market pricing indicates reductions in policy rates further ahead. UK domestic inflationary pressures have been firmer than expected. Both private sector regular pay growth and services CPI inflation have been notably higher than forecast in the November Monetary Policy Report. The labour market remains tight by historical standards, although it has started to loosen and some survey indicators of wage growth have eased, alongside a gradual decline in underlying output. Given the lags in monetary policy transmission, the increases in Bank Rate since December 2021 are expected to have an increasing impact on the economy in the coming quarters. Near-term data developments will be crucial in assessing how quickly and to what extent external and domestic inflationary pressures will abate. As set out in the accompanying February Monetary Policy Report, the MPC’s updated projections show CPI inflation falling back sharply from its current very elevated level, of 10.5% in December, in large part owing to past increases in energy and other goods prices falling out of the calculation of the annual rate. Annual CPI inflation is expected to fall to around 4% towards the end of this year, alongside a much shallower projected decline in output than in the November Report forecast. In the latest modal forecast, conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rises to around 4½% in mid-2023 and falls back to just over 3¼% in three years’ time, an increasing degree of economic slack, alongside falling external pressures, leads CPI inflation to decline to below the 2% target in the medium term. There are considerable uncertainties around this medium-term outlook, and the Committee continues to judge that the risks to inflation are skewed significantly to the upside. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has been subject to a sequence of very large and overlapping shocks. Monetary policy will ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continues, CPI inflation will return to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy is also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2% target. The Committee has voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 4%, at this meeting. Headline CPI inflation has begun to edge back and is likely to fall sharply over the rest of the year as a result of past movements in energy and other goods prices. However, the labour market remains tight and domestic price and wage pressures have been stronger than expected, suggesting risks of greater persistence in underlying inflation. The extent to which domestic inflationary pressures ease will depend on the evolution of the economy, including the impact of the significant increases in Bank Rate so far. There are considerable uncertainties around the outlook. The MPC will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services inflation. If there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required. Looking further ahead, the MPC will adjust Bank Rate as necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 1 February 2023 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the backdrop of its latest economic projections, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: Global GDP growth had probably slowed in 2022 Q4, accounted for by weakening growth in the euro area and subdued economic activity in China owing to an increase in Covid cases. UK-weighted world GDP was expected to continue to be subdued in the near term. Global consumer price inflation remained elevated, although it was likely to have peaked in many advanced economies. It was projected to fall over the course of 2023 following declines in energy prices and as global demand weakened and supply chain pressures eased. 3: In the euro area, GDP growth had slowed in recent quarters as real incomes had been squeezed by higher energy and food prices. Following growth of 0.3% in 2022 Q3, GDP had risen by 0.1% in Q4 according to the preliminary flash estimate, a little higher than expected in the November and February Monetary Policy Report projections. The S&P Global euro-area flash composite output PMI had risen a little above the 50 no-change mark in January, although the forward-looking new orders index had remained in contractionary territory. 4: In the United States, GDP had increased by 0.7% in 2022 Q4, only marginally lower than in Q3, and significantly stronger than anticipated in the November and February Report forecasts. Although financial conditions had loosened further since the MPC’s previous meeting, they were much tighter than a year ago and were expected to continue to weigh on growth in coming quarters. Survey indicators such as the ISM PMIs had also pointed towards weaker growth. 5: In China, rising Covid cases had weighed on activity in the final quarter of 2022. GDP growth had been flat in Q4, much weaker than the 1.4% growth rate expected at the time of the November Report, and activity in 2023 Q1 was also expected to be weak. In early December, China had begun to remove Covid restrictions, effectively ending its zero-Covid policy, and mobility measures had fallen sharply. Retail sales had fallen in December relative to a year earlier while industrial production had increased, consistent with the impact of the latest Covid wave being greater on consumption than on manufacturing output. This suggested that global supply chains might be less disrupted than after previous Covid waves in China, reducing any upward impact on global goods prices and hence UK inflation. Moreover, the removal of restrictions would reduce the likelihood of future lockdowns, and hence potential future supply chain disruption. Chinese GDP growth was expected to recover in coming quarters. 6: European natural gas prices had fallen markedly since the MPC’s December meeting. The Dutch Title Transfer Facility spot price, had declined to €58 per MWh, down nearly 60%, and the gas futures curve had also fallen significantly. Relatively mild weather had contributed to lower gas consumption in continental Europe, alleviating supply concerns for next winter as storage levels had remained high. These developments had also caused large downward movements in UK wholesale gas prices. The Brent crude oil spot price had risen by around 5%, to $85 per barrel. The prices of agricultural goods had increased by around 4% since the MPC's December meeting. 7: Global consumer price inflation appeared to have peaked. In the euro area, the flash estimate had suggested that annual headline HICP inflation decreased for the third consecutive month in January, falling by 0.7 percentage points to 8.5%. The decline had been driven by a reduction in energy price inflation. Core inflation had remained unchanged at 5.2%. In the United States, annual PCE inflation had fallen to 5.0% in December, its lowest level since September 2021, and down from 5.5% in November. Upward pressure from energy and core goods prices had continued to fade. Core PCE inflation had declined to 4.4%. 8: The MPC discussed how monetary policy tightening over the past year had affected economic activity in the United States and the euro area. Financial conditions had possibly tightened a little more than in previous tightening cycles in the United States, including mortgage rates, but had been somewhat more similar to historical episodes in the euro area. Indicators of consumption had declined, broadly in line with what might have been expected in the United States, while the broader real income squeeze was contributing materially to the weakness in the euro area. Given lags in the transmission of monetary policy, it was too early to judge the impact on inflation, but published forecasts from both the Federal Reserve and the ECB had suggested some persistence in inflationary pressures. Monetary and financial conditions 9: Many central banks had continued to tighten monetary policy, and market pricing implied that policy rates were likely to increase further in the near term. In December, both the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the ECB Governing Council had increased policy rates by 50 basis points. The target range for the federal funds rate was 4¼ to 4½% and the interest rate on the ECB’s deposit facility was 2%. The FOMC and ECB Governing Council were expected to increase rates by a further 25 and 50 basis points respectively at their forthcoming meetings concluding on 1 and 2 February. The peak in the market-implied policy path in the United States was little changed since the MPC’s previous meeting, at a little under 5%. In the euro area, the peak in the market-implied policy path had risen somewhat, to a little under 3½%. 10: A large majority of respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected Bank Rate to be increased by 50 basis points at this MPC meeting, broadly consistent with market-implied pricing. The median MaPS respondent expected Bank Rate to reach a peak of 4¼% in March and to remain at that level throughout the rest of 2023, broadly unchanged since the previous survey. The market-implied path for Bank Rate rose to around 4½% by the middle of this year, down a little since the MPC’s previous meeting and further closing the gap with the median path in the MaPS. 11: Further out, market-implied paths remained consistent with expectations of a reduction in policy rates. In the United States, by end-2025, the market implied policy path was around 2 percentage points lower than the expected peak in rates, compared with around 1 percentage point lower in the United Kingdom and euro area. 12: Risky asset prices had risen globally since the November Monetary Policy Report, including in the period since the MPC’s December meeting. Easing global inflation concerns had supported risk appetite. Overall, stronger equity prices, narrower corporate borrowing spreads and lower expectations for policy rates had contributed to some loosening in global financial conditions since the November Report. In the United Kingdom, those moves had in part reflected an unwinding of the higher premia required to invest in UK assets associated with the market volatility in late September and October last year. 13: The sterling effective exchange rate had depreciated somewhat since the previous MPC meeting, but remained around 1% higher than at the time of the November Report. Over the quarter, there had been a broad-based depreciation of the US dollar, consistent with some improvement in global risk sentiment as well as the somewhat larger declines in US interest rate expectations relative to other advanced economies over the period. 14: There had been a further reduction in financial market participants’ near-term inflation expectations since the MPC’s December meeting, in part reflecting falls in wholesale gas prices. In the United Kingdom, the median of MaPS respondents’ expectations for CPI inflation one and two years ahead had fallen to 3.5% and 2.5% respectively, compared to 5.5% and 3.0% in the previous survey in December. At both the three and five-year horizons, median CPI inflation expectations had remained at 2%, although responses had still been skewed to the upside. 15: The Committee discussed movements in UK medium-term inflation compensation measures. There had been a material reduction in these measures since their peak last March, although they had remained above their average levels of the previous decade. Interpreting moves in inflation compensation measures remained challenging, particularly following the significant market volatility last September and October, when there had been large distortions from the repricing in long-dated and index-linked UK government debt, and associated pressure on liability-driven investment (LDI) funds. Nevertheless, looking further back, market contacts had attributed the majority of the fall in these measures since last March to fundamental factors, including falling central expectations for inflation and changing perceptions of the balance of risks around the inflation outlook. That said, market technical factors, including those associated with pressure on LDI funds last autumn, were also attributed a significant role in explaining moves in inflation compensation measures. 16: There had been a continued reduction in UK owner-occupied fixed-term mortgage rates since the Committee’s previous meeting, but rates had remained materially higher than in the summer. The average quoted rates on two-year fixed-rate 90% and 75% loan-to-value mortgages stood at 6.0% and 5.4% in December, around 30 basis points and 50 basis points lower than in November. Preliminary data for January suggested that rates had fallen by a further 25 basis points. Spreads on these mortgage products relative to their relevant risk-free rate had fallen since November, leaving them not far from their 2016 to 2019 average levels. 17: There had been a large net reduction in sterling broad money in 2022 Q4. Cumulatively, net money outflows from October to December had more than reversed the very large increase recorded in September. These flows were accounted for primarily by some firms in the financial sector. One contributory factor to these large flows was likely to have been the significant market volatility towards the end of September, associated with developments at LDI funds. 18: On 12 January, the MPC had been informed that the Bank of England had completed its sales of its temporary holdings of UK government bonds purchased in autumn 2022 on financial stability grounds. Demand and output 19: Although UK quarterly GDP growth in 2022 Q3 had been revised down to -0.3% in the Quarterly National Accounts, it was stronger than had been expected at the time of the November Monetary Policy Report. Estimates of GDP had been revised lower in preceding quarters, which meant that the level of GDP in Q3 had remained slightly below its pre-Covid level. Although the weakness in the third quarter in part reflected the additional bank holiday for the Queen’s state funeral in September, it had primarily been driven by weakness in underlying output. 20: Monthly GDP had been estimated to have risen by 0.1% in November, following a 0.5% increase in October. Bank staff now expected GDP to have grown by 0.1% in 2022 Q4 as a whole, stronger than at the time of the November Report. Underlying output had remained weak. The small rise in headline GDP expected in Q4 in part reflected some temporary factors such as the recovery in activity following the Queen’s state funeral. 21: GDP was expected to decline by 0.1% in 2023 Q1. Business surveys such as the S&P Global/CIPS UK flash PMIs, in which the output and new orders indices had remained below the 50 no-change mark in January, were consistent with small falls in GDP. Other business surveys had painted a similar picture of output growth being close to zero. The future output PMI, which covered firms’ expectations for output over the next year, had increased in recent months but remained below its historical average. Continued underlying weakness in GDP growth was in part likely to reflect the fall in real household incomes, and hence consumer spending, due to high global energy and tradeable goods prices. 22: Household consumption had contracted by 1.1% in 2022 Q3, and spending on goods, as indicated by retail sales volumes, had been on a downward trend since spring 2021, in part due to spending transitioning from goods to services following the pandemic. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had noted customers trading down to lower-priced products and a drop in demand for household goods. GfK consumer confidence had remained around historically low levels in January. 23: Business investment had been weak for some time and had fallen by 2.5% in 2022 Q3. Overall, business investment was around 8% below its pre-Covid level and was likely to remain subdued in the near term. Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that weak demand, tighter financial conditions and uncertainty about the outlook were holding back investment spending. 24: Housing investment growth had slowed to close to zero in 2022 Q3. The weakness in the economic outlook, combined with the impact of higher mortgage rates on the housing market, were expected to continue to weigh on housing investment. Leading indicators of house prices such as the Halifax and Nationwide indices had also pointed to falls since September. These recent moves were in contrast to the trend observed since the pandemic of strong growth in housing investment, activity and prices. The latest Credit Conditions Survey suggested that the availability of secured lending to households had declined in 2022 Q4, with further falls in availability expected in 2023 Q1. Loan approvals for house purchase had declined sharply in November and December when mortgage pricing had been more expensive. The Committee noted that although the causal links between house prices and spending had been reasonably modest historically in the United Kingdom, house prices had tended to have a strong correlation with consumption. 25: There was some evidence that the slowdown in output growth was leading to a softening in labour demand, although the labour market had remained tight. Labour Force Survey (LFS) employment growth had slowed over the second half of 2022, reflecting the past slowdown in GDP growth, and timelier survey indicators of labour demand had been consistent with stagnating employment. Business contacts of the Agents had reported a further easing in recruitment difficulties, but that hiring and retention difficulties had remained above normal across a range of sectors. Although the number of job vacancies had fallen, they had remained elevated. The LFS unemployment rate had remained at a historically low level of 3.7% in the three months to November, and in the February Report forecast was projected to rise only gradually over the course of the year. Many of the Agents’ business contacts had reported that they were reluctant to reduce headcount actively, and intended to accommodate weaker demand through attrition or by reducing working hours. Supply, costs and prices 26: Twelve-month CPI inflation had edged down to 10.5% in December, from 10.7% in November, accounted for by a decline in fuel prices on the month. Core CPI inflation, excluding energy, food, beverages and tobacco, had remained unchanged at 6.3%, and was broadly in line with the November Monetary Policy Report projection. Core goods inflation had fallen by more than had been anticipated, to 5.8%, but services inflation had surprised to the upside, rising to a 30-year high of 6.8%. 27: In the February Report forecast, CPI inflation was projected to fall to around 8% by the middle of this year, as previous large increases in energy and other goods prices dropped out of the calculation of the annual rate. Core goods inflation was expected to continue to moderate, albeit remaining robust, consistent with global supply chains improving and survey indicators of manufacturers’ cost pressures easing. 28: Retail gas and electricity prices were currently subject to the Government’s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG). The EPG for a typical annual dual-fuel bill was due to increase from £2,500 to £3,000 in April. Retail energy prices were also expected to rise by 20% at that point, because even though wholesale gas futures prices had fallen recently, those declines were unlikely to push Ofgem’s energy price caps for April below the revised EPG. A 20% increase would be smaller than the increase of more than 50% in household energy bills in April 2022, such that the direct contribution of energy to twelve-month CPI inflation was expected to fall. If sustained, the latest falls in gas futures prices would push the Ofgem price caps below the EPG ceiling in July, and so pull down household energy prices. 29: Services CPI inflation was expected to remain around recent historically high rates over the first half of the year, in large part reflecting ongoing strength in pay growth. Bank staff analysis suggested that labour costs tended to be the predominant driver of services inflation in the long run, although higher non-labour input costs and firms rebuilding their margins had also been pushing up services prices recently. 30: The Committee discussed the potential persistence of recent inflation dynamics, and the role of wages in particular. A series of global shocks over the past few years had resulted in sharp and successive increases in the prices of tradeable goods, including energy, which continued to be passed through supply chains. There had been signs that these global pressures were beginning to abate. But the risk of greater inflation persistence, through the interactions of global pressures with domestic wage and price setting, remained in the context of a tight labour market. Relatedly, measures of inflation expectations over the year ahead had remained elevated. 31: Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings growth had risen to a little over 7% in the three months to November, 0.7 percentage points above the November Report projection. Annual private sector wage growth was expected to flatten off at a similar rate in 2023 H1, consistent with higher-frequency pay growth also plateauing. A survey of firms conducted by the Bank’s Agents suggested that the average pay settlement in 2023 would rise at a broadly similar rate as in 2022. Survey respondents had expected consumer price inflation to be the main driver of pay settlements. Within the survey, there were tentative indications of pay pressures moderating over the year, with expected pay settlements a little lower in the second half of the year than in the first half. The measure of pay for new permanent hires in the KPMG/REC survey, which was a leading indicator for private sector pay growth three to four quarters ahead, suggested a more pronounced slowing in pay growth later in the year. 32: Measures of inflation expectations had fallen back from their recent peaks, but most were still at elevated levels. The Citi/YouGov household measures of inflation expectations over the next year and five-to-ten years ahead had edged down in January, to 5.4% and 3.5% respectively, following steeper falls in December. Respondents to the Decision Maker Panel in January had revised down their expectations for CPI inflation over the year ahead, to 6.4%, but had left their own price expectations unchanged, at 5.8%. Professional forecasters responding to the Bank’s latest quarterly survey were, on average, projecting CPI inflation to fall to 3.9% in one year’s time, and to be in line with the 2% inflation target three years ahead. The immediate policy decision 33: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 34: UK domestic inflationary pressures had been firmer than expected. Both private sector regular pay growth and services CPI inflation had been notably higher than forecast in the November Monetary Policy Report. The labour market had remained tight by historical standards. The unemployment rate had been 3.7% in the three months to November, below the MPC’s assessment of the long-term equilibrium rate of unemployment, which stood at just above 4%. GDP growth had surprised to the upside in 2022 H2, relative to the November Report forecast. Underlying output was declining gradually, however. There were signs that the labour market had started to loosen and some survey indicators of wage growth had eased. Wholesale gas prices had fallen recently, and consumer price inflation was likely to have peaked across many advanced economies. Measures of UK inflation expectations had fallen back from their recent peaks, but most were still at elevated levels. 35: As set out in the accompanying February Monetary Policy Report, the MPC’s updated projections showed CPI inflation falling back sharply from its current very elevated level, of 10.5% in December, in large part owing to past increases in energy and other goods prices falling out of the calculation of the annual rate. Annual CPI inflation was expected to fall to around 4% towards the end of this year, alongside a much shallower projected decline in output than in the November Report forecast. 36: In the latest modal forecast, conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rose to around 4½% in mid-2023 and fell back to just over 3¼% in three years’ time, an increasing degree of economic slack, alongside falling external pressures, led CPI inflation to decline to below the 2% target in the medium term. There were considerable uncertainties around this medium-term outlook, and the Committee continued to judge that the risks to inflation were skewed significantly to the upside, primarily reflecting the possibility of greater persistence in domestic wage and price setting, and also upside risks to the wholesale energy price conditioning assumption. Qualitatively, an inflation forecast that took into account these upside risks was judged to be much closer to the 2% target at the policy horizon than the modal central projection. 37: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy had been subject to a sequence of very large and overlapping shocks. Monetary policy would ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continued, CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. 38: Seven members judged that a 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 4%, was warranted at this meeting. Economic activity had weakened, but there had been some signs of greater resilience in the most recent data. Headline CPI inflation had begun to edge back and was likely to fall sharply over the rest of the year, as a result of past developments in energy and other goods prices. However, the labour market had remained tight and domestic price and wage pressures had been stronger than expected, suggesting risks of greater persistence in underlying inflation. Measures of inflation expectations were still at elevated levels. The risks to the inflation outlook in the medium term were both large and asymmetric, with a skew towards greater persistence. This warranted additional weight being put on recent strength in the labour market and inflation data, and relatively less on the medium-term projections. A 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate at this meeting would address the risk that domestic wage and price pressures remained elevated even as external cost pressures waned. 39: Two members preferred to leave Bank Rate unchanged at 3.5% at this meeting. The real economy remained weak, as a result of falling real incomes and the tightening in financial conditions over the past year. There were continuing signs that the downturn was affecting the labour market, especially in more forward-looking indicators. At the same time, the lags in the effects of monetary policy meant that sizeable impacts from past rate increases were still to come through. That implied the current setting of Bank Rate would be likely to reduce inflation to well below target in the medium term. As the policy setting had become increasingly restrictive, this would bring forward the point at which recent rate increases would need to be reversed. 40: The extent to which domestic inflationary pressures eased would depend on the evolution of the economy, including the impact of the significant increases in Bank Rate so far. There were considerable uncertainties around the outlook. The MPC would continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services inflation. If there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required. 41: Looking further ahead, the MPC would adjust Bank Rate as necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. 42: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.5 percentage points, to 4%. 43: Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Silvana Tenreyro) voted against the proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 3.5%. Operational considerations 44: On 1 February 2023, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £838 billion, comprising £826 billion of UK government bond purchases and £11.5 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases. 45: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Swati Dhingra Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Silvana Tenreyro Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. 46: As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, David Roberts was also present on 27 January, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 22 March will be published on 23 March 2023.

At its meeting ending on 22 March 2023, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%. Two members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4%. Global growth is expected to be stronger than projected in the February Monetary Policy Report, and core consumer price inflation in advanced economies has remained elevated. Wholesale gas futures and oil prices have fallen materially. There have been large and volatile moves in global financial markets, in particular since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and in the run-up to UBS’s purchase of Credit Suisse, and reflecting market concerns about the possible broader impact of these events. Overall, government bond yields are broadly unchanged and risky asset prices are somewhat lower than at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting. The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) has briefed the MPC about recent global banking sector developments. The FPC judges that the UK banking system maintains robust capital and strong liquidity positions, and is well placed to continue supporting the economy in a wide range of economic scenarios, including in a period of higher interest rates. The FPC’s assessment is that the UK banking system remains resilient. Reflecting these developments, bank wholesale funding costs have risen in the United Kingdom and other advanced economies. The MPC will continue to monitor closely any effects on the credit conditions faced by households and businesses, and hence the impact on the macroeconomic and inflation outlook. Additional fiscal support was announced in the Spring Budget. Bank staff have provisionally estimated that this could, relative to the February Report, increase the level of GDP by around 0.3% over coming years. A full assessment, including the extent to which these measures could affect supply as well as demand in the medium term, will be conducted ahead of the May Monetary Policy Report. GDP is still likely to have been broadly flat around the turn of the year, but is now expected to increase slightly in the second quarter, compared with the 0.4% decline anticipated in the February Report. As the Government’s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) will be maintained at £2,500 for three further months from April, real household disposable income could remain broadly flat in the near term, rather than falling significantly. The labour market has remained tight, while the news since the MPC’s previous meeting points to stronger-than-expected employment growth in 2023 Q2 and a flat rather than rising unemployment rate. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell from 10.5% in December to 10.1% in January but then rose to 10.4% in February, 0.6 percentage points higher than expected in the February Report. As a consequence, the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer is being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Services CPI inflation was 6.6% in February, 0.1 percentage points weaker than expected at the time of the February Report, but food and core goods price inflation have been significantly stronger than projected. Most of the surprising strength in the core goods component was accounted for by higher clothing and footwear prices, which tend to be volatile and could therefore prove less persistent. Annual private sector regular earnings growth has eased, to 7% in the three months to January, 0.1 percentage points below the expectation in February. CPI inflation is still expected to fall significantly in 2023 Q2, to a lower rate than anticipated in the February Report. This lower-than-expected rate is largely due to the near-term news in the Budget including on the EPG, alongside the falls in wholesale energy prices. Services CPI inflation is expected to remain broadly unchanged in the near term, but wage growth is likely to fall back somewhat more quickly than projected in the February Report. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has been subject to a sequence of very large and overlapping shocks. Monetary policy will ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continues, CPI inflation will return to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy is also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2% target. The Committee has voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%, at this meeting. CPI inflation increased unexpectedly in the latest release, but it remains likely to fall sharply over the rest of the year. Services inflation has been broadly in line with expectations. The labour market has remained tight, and the near-term paths of GDP and employment are likely to be somewhat stronger than expected previously. Although nominal wage growth has been weaker than expected, cost and price pressures have remained elevated. The extent to which domestic inflationary pressures ease will depend on the evolution of the economy, including the impact of the significant increases in Bank Rate so far. Uncertainties around the financial and economic outlook have risen. The MPC will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services inflation. If there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required. The MPC will make a full assessment of all of the news since the February Report, including the economic implications of recent financial market and banking sector developments, as part of its forthcoming May forecast round. The MPC will adjust Bank Rate as necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 22 March 2023 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: UK-weighted world GDP had increased by 0.3% in 2022 Q4 and was expected to grow by 0.4% in 2023 Q1. That expectation for the first quarter was stronger than had been anticipated in the February Monetary Policy Report, accounted for by expectations of a sharper rebound in Chinese GDP following the end of its zero-Covid policy in December, as well as upside news to demand in the United States and in the euro area. Downside risks to the outlook nevertheless remained. In particular, it was unclear how credit conditions and economic activity might be affected by recent banking sector stress in a number of advanced economies. 3: In the euro area, GDP had been flat in 2022 Q4, in line with the projection in the February Report, and was expected to increase by 0.1% in 2023 Q1, stronger than had been incorporated into the February Report. The S&P Global euro-area composite output PMI had risen to its highest level in eight months in February, indicating expanding activity in both services and manufacturing. 4: In the United States, GDP had increased by 0.7% in 2022 Q4 and was expected to grow by 0.3% in 2023 Q1, both stronger than had been expected in the February Report. Retail sales and real consumption had grown strongly in January, and the ISM non-manufacturing PMIs suggested robust GDP growth in January and February, although the ISM manufacturing output PMI had remained below the 50 no-change mark. Around 810,000 jobs had been added to the US economy over January and February, and the unemployment rate had remained near record lows. 5: In China, economic activity had rebounded following the end of its zero-Covid policy in December. The economy was now expected to grow by 1.6% in 2023 Q1, materially stronger than the 1% contraction that had been incorporated into the February Report. The rebound was likely to have been concentrated in domestic demand, reflecting the lifting of Covid-related restrictions and less voluntary social distancing as the number of Covid cases had peaked earlier than had been expected previously. The NBS non-manufacturing and Caixin services PMIs in January and February had been strong, and stronger than their manufacturing counterparts. Retail sales had surged, and investment and industrial production growth had picked up relative to a year earlier. A measure of Chinese supply chain constraints had eased, and most indicators of global shipping costs had continued to decline. Overall, China’s reopening was likely to be disinflationary for advanced economies, as the easing of supply chain disruption was expected to outweigh positive spillovers from stronger demand. 6: European natural gas prices had fallen materially since the MPC’s February meeting. The Dutch Title Transfer Facility spot price, a measure of European wholesale gas prices, had declined to €42 per MWh, down 26% relative to February and below levels seen just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The gas futures curve had also fallen further. These falls had been driven by milder weather, less energy use and fuel switching, implying that gas storage levels had continued to be high, although risks remained for the next winter. UK wholesale gas prices had fallen in line with their continental European counterparts. More recently, the possible macroeconomic implications of the financial market volatility that had followed the failure of Silicon Valley Bank had also contributed to falls in commodity prices. The Brent crude oil spot price had fallen by 12%, to $75 per barrel, since the MPC’s previous meeting, and the prices of agricultural goods and metals had also declined. 7: Headline consumer price inflation had continued to decline in the euro area and the United States, but core CPI inflation had proved somewhat more persistent than had been expected. In the euro area, annual headline HICP inflation had been 8.5% in February, down from 8.6% in January, but annual core inflation had increased to 5.6%, from 5.3%. Both measures had been higher than expected by market participants, and the increase had largely been accounted for by services price inflation. Energy price inflation had continued to decline, and was expected to decline further on the back of lower wholesale gas prices, which would push down on headline relative to core measures in the near term. Wage growth in the euro area had continued to increase, albeit from a lower level than in other advanced economies. 8: In the United States, annual headline CPI inflation had decreased to 6.0% in February, from 6.4% in January, while core inflation had fallen marginally to 5.5% from 5.6%, in line with market expectations. However, annual headline and core PCE inflation had surprised to the upside in January. This strength had been accounted for by energy and housing cost inflation, which were expected to ease. Annual average hourly earnings growth had ticked up in the United States in February, following some moderation in previous months. 9: The MPC discussed the extent to which lower wholesale energy prices might already have boosted global activity in the first quarter, noting that most of the effect was still likely to come through as government price caps on households in Europe had cushioned the adverse effect on retail prices and activity while wholesale prices had been higher. The Committee also discussed what the net effect of upside news on economic activity and lower energy prices might be on global inflation. On the one hand, lower energy prices would push down on headline inflation, and also on core inflation via indirect and second-round effects. On the other hand, lower energy prices would push up demand, which, taken together with other factors pushing up GDP, and all else equal, would be likely to put upward pressure on global inflation. Monetary and financial conditions 10: There had been large and volatile moves in financial markets since the MPC’s previous meeting, in particular since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in early March and reflecting market concerns about the possible broader impact of these events. In the days leading up to the MPC’s decision, UBS had agreed to buy Credit Suisse, and major advanced economy central banks had announced a coordinated action to enhance the provision of liquidity via the standing US dollar liquidity swap line arrangements. Overall, government bond yields were broadly unchanged and risky asset prices were somewhat lower than at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting. 11: The change in aggregate indices of equity prices in major advanced economies had been modest by the end of the period relative to the time of the MPC’s previous meeting. Bank equity prices had, however, been particularly affected as market sentiment had deteriorated following news about SVB, ending the period around 20% lower in the United States and around 5 to 10% down in the euro area and the United Kingdom. Measures of UK wholesale bank funding costs had risen, while remaining below the peaks seen in autumn 2022. 12: Prior to concerns emerging about SVB, market-implied monetary policy paths had picked up materially in advanced economies, reflecting positive global macroeconomic news, coupled with market interpretations of the tone of communications from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), and the ECB Governing Council. These factors had also pushed up on market-implied policy paths in other countries, including in the United Kingdom. 13: After the issues at SVB had become public, however, risk sentiment had reversed and volatility had picked up, such that government bond yields globally had moved appreciably lower again. Risk sentiment had remained weak, given fragilities revealed at some other individual banks. Market contacts suggested that the fall in yields had largely reflected a flight to safety as market participants sought to wait out the volatility, while there was also some perception of an increase in downside risks to the outlook for growth and inflation. 14: Market expectations for the near-term path of policy rates in the euro area and the United States had ended the period largely unchanged and were expected to peak at a level similar to that at the time of the MPC’s previous meeting, at around 3½% and around 5% respectively. At its meeting ending on 16 March, the ECB Governing Council had raised its key policy rates by 50 basis points, a little higher than had been implied by market pricing immediately before the announcement. At the FOMC’s meeting ending on 22 March, market pricing was consistent with expectations of an increase in the federal funds rate of around 20 basis points. In the United Kingdom, the majority of market contacts expected Bank Rate to be increased by 25 basis points at this MPC meeting, and market pricing had risen consistent with these expectations following the release of February CPI data immediately prior to the MPC’s decision. The market-implied path of Bank Rate rose to a peak of a little above 4½% in August 2023, somewhat higher than the peak at the time of the MPC’s previous meeting. 15: Further out, market-implied paths remained consistent with expectations of a reduction in policy rates. In the United States, by mid-2026, the market-implied policy rate was just under 2 percentage points lower than the expected peak in rates, while the same rates were around 1½ percentage points lower than the peak in the United Kingdom and ¾ percentage points lower in the euro area. 16: The sterling effective exchange rate had ended the period around ½% higher compared to the time of the MPC’s previous meeting. 17: Medium-term inflation compensation measures had increased a little in the United Kingdom, and had remained broadly unchanged in the United States and the euro area, since the MPC’s previous meeting. Although interpreting the movements in UK medium-term inflation compensation measures continued to be challenging, it remained the case that there had been a material reduction in these measures since their peak in March 2022, while they had remained above their average levels of the previous decade. 18: There had been a further reduction in UK owner-occupied fixed-term mortgage rates since the MPC’s previous meeting, although rates remained materially higher than in summer 2022. The average quoted rate on a two-year fixed-rate 75% loan-to-value mortgage had fallen by 35 basis points in February, to 4.8%. More generally, the pass-through of higher risk-free reference rates during the current monetary policy tightening cycle had occurred broadly in line with what had typically been the case in the past, excepting the temporary period of slightly faster-than-typical pass-through in 2022 Q4. There were no clear signs as yet that the recent increase in UK bank funding costs had affected mortgage rates. 19: Net secured lending to households had decreased somewhat further, to £2.5 billion in January from £3.1 billion in December. Mortgage approvals for house purchase, which had been falling since autumn 2022, had remained fairly stable in January, at historically low levels of just under 40,000. 20: There had continued to be weakness in other housing market indicators. The official UK House Price Index had fallen by 0.5% a month on average over December and January, and leading indicators such as the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices pointed to falls of around 3 to 4% compared to their peak in autumn 2022. Indicators of housing market activity from the RICS survey had increased a little in February but had remained weak. 21: Sight deposit rates had risen since the MPC’s February meeting, though by less than the increase in Bank Rate. Relative to changes in the corresponding risk-free reference rates, the increase in sight deposit rates since the beginning of the current tightening cycle had been significantly less pronounced than it had been in past cycles, in contrast to time deposits, which had been broadly in line. There was some evidence that households might have rebalanced away from sight to time deposits in response. Demand and output 22: According to the ONS’s first quarterly estimate, real GDP had been flat in 2022 Q4, marginally weaker than had been expected in the February Monetary Policy Report. Household consumption had risen by 0.1%, while business investment had been estimated to have increased by almost 5%. Investment had also been revised up since the start of 2022, such that its level in 2022 Q3 was only 4½% below its pre-pandemic level, rather than 8% as in the previous estimate. 23: Monthly GDP had increased by 0.3% in January, following a 0.5% fall in December. This volatility in the monthly path had in large part been accounted for by a fall and subsequent partial rebound in health and education output around the turn of the year, reflecting the pattern of public-sector strike activity and sickness. Market sector output had risen by 0.1% in January, partially unwinding the 0.2% decline in December. Looking through the bank holiday-related volatility in GDP at various points last year, the level of market sector output had been broadly unchanged since the spring. 24: Bank staff continued to expect GDP to decline by 0.1% in 2023 Q1, as had been projected in the February Report. That was broadly consistent with the overall signal from business surveys of activity. In February, the S&P Global/CIPS UK composite output and new orders PMI indices had risen to levels close to their historical averages, whereas the CBI composite output balance had picked up but had remained contractionary. 25: Household consumption and business investment were also likely to be subdued in the first quarter. Retail sales volumes had risen by 0.5% in January, following a 1.2% decline in December. GfK consumer confidence had increased in February, to its highest level since April 2022, but had nevertheless remained well below its historical average. Most surveys of businesses’ investment intentions had remained weak. 26: The Spring Budget had taken place on 15 March, accompanied by an Economic and fiscal outlook from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Additional fiscal support had been announced, including further energy support measures for households and businesses, temporary 100% capital allowances for qualifying business investment undertaken between 2023-24 and 2025-26, a package of measures aimed at increasing labour market participation, higher defence spending and a freeze in fuel duty. Bank staff had provisionally estimated that these additional policy measures could, relative to what had been assumed in the February Monetary Policy Report, increase the level of GDP by around 0.3% over coming years. A full assessment of this news, and the extent to which it could affect supply as well as demand in the medium term, would be conducted as part of the May Monetary Policy Report forecast round. 27: Bank staff now expected GDP to increase slightly in the second quarter, compared with the 0.4% decline incorporated in the February Report. The Bank’s Agents had reported that, while subdued overall, activity was holding up better than contacts had previously expected, particularly in the consumer services sector. The composite future output PMI had risen further in February, with the associated report highlighting improved confidence regarding the near-term economic outlook. The news that the Government’s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) for a typical annual dual-fuel bill would be maintained at £2,500 in April rather than increased, suggested that real household disposable income could remain broadly flat in the near term, rather than falling significantly as had been expected previously. 28: The Committee discussed these developments in activity. Some of the prospective upside news in GDP was likely to reflect developments in energy prices, including recent declines in wholesale prices as well as the EPG adjustment, and hence a further unwind of the terms of trade shock that households and businesses had been experiencing. But some of the news could reflect other factors, including the continued momentum in employment growth. This channel was similar to the judgement that the MPC had made in the February Report that lower perceptions of the risk of job losses could result in lower precautionary saving by households than had previously been assumed. Activity could therefore be less weak than expected. Supply, costs and prices 29: The labour market had remained tight, while the news since the MPC’s previous meeting pointed to stronger-than-expected employment growth and participation. The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had remained at 3.7% in the three months to January, 0.1 percentage points below the expectation at the time of the February Monetary Policy Report. LFS employment had grown by 0.2% in the three months to January, slightly stronger than had been expected at the time of the February Report. This stronger-than-expected rise in employment had been the counterpart to a fall in the inactivity rate of the 16+ population. LFS data for 2022 Q4 suggested that the flow into inactivity from employment and unemployment had fallen to around pre-Covid levels, alongside a decline in the share of the inactive aged 50-64 who did not expect to work again. 30: Some other indicators of labour market quantities had strengthened in recent months, alongside a similar development in some output indicators. The composite employment index in the S&P Global/CIPS UK PMI and HMRC employee payrolls had both increased in February. The rate of decline in the stock of vacancies had continued to abate in the three months to February. There had been just over 1.1 million vacancies in the three months to February, around one third higher than prior to the pandemic. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported that the labour market remained tight, with little sign of loosening. Nevertheless, contacts had reported that churn in jobs had fallen back, and that recruitment difficulties had eased recently but remained elevated. Overall, Bank staff expected employment growth of 0.2% in 2023 Q2, in comparison to the 0.4% decline that had been anticipated in the February Report, and for the unemployment rate to remain around its current low level rather than starting to rise. 31: Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth had eased slightly to 7% in the three months to January, 0.1 percentage points below the expectation at the time of the February Report. Three month on three month private sector regular AWE growth had fallen significantly in recent months. Other pay growth indicators, such as the KPMG/REC survey measure of pay for new permanent hires, suggested that private sector regular pay growth could undershoot somewhat the near-term projections in the February Report. In that Report, earnings growth had been projected to soften in the second half of this year, as lower inflation expectations, which were anticipated to be quantitatively more important than changes in slack in the current environment, pulled down on pay growth. 32: Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 10.4% in February from 10.1% in January. This release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. The February figure had been 0.6 percentage points higher than the expectation at the time of the February Report, with the upside news concentrated in clothing and footwear, and food and non-alcoholic beverages. Clothing and footwear prices had tended to be volatile and this news could therefore prove less persistent. Core CPI inflation, excluding energy, food, beverages and tobacco, had risen to 6.2% in February from 5.8% in January, and had been 0.3 percentage points higher than the expectation made at the time of the February Report. 33: Bank staff still expected CPI inflation to fall significantly in 2023 Q2, to a lower rate than had been anticipated in the February Report. This lower-than-expected rate was due largely to developments in administered energy prices. Retail gas and electricity prices were currently subject to the Government’s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG). As part of the Spring Budget, the Government had announced that the EPG would now be maintained at £2,500, for a typical dual-fuel bill, for the three months from April. This change in the EPG represented downside news to the outlook for household energy prices, lowering directly the forecast for CPI inflation in 2023 Q2 by around 1 percentage point, all else equal. Other measures announced in the Budget, such as the freezing of fuel duty, had contributed around a further ⅓ percentage points of downside news to the inflation forecast, from April. 34: Staff expected CPI inflation to decline further beyond 2023 Q2, due largely to falls in wholesale gas futures prices. If that level of futures prices were to be sustained, it would mean that the EPG would not bind on household energy bills from July. Instead, Ofgem price caps would set the price of domestic energy bills, resetting every three months as per Ofgem’s method. The latest Bank staff estimates suggested that the direct energy contribution to CPI inflation would turn negative by the end of this year. 35: Households’ and businesses’ short-term inflation expectations had continued to fall back. The quarterly Bank/Ipsos survey had reported a fall in year-ahead inflation expectations to around 4%. By contrast, the measure of one-year ahead inflation expectations in the Citi/YouGov survey of households had edged up in February, though had remained materially below its peak observed last August. The DMP survey had reported that businesses’ expectations about their own prices a year ahead had fallen further in February, albeit they had remained at an elevated level. The Bank/Ipsos measures of households’ two- and five-year ahead inflation expectations had been close to their historical averages. 36: The Committee discussed the persistence of inflation. Services CPI inflation had reached 6.6% in February and was expected to remain broadly unchanged in the near term, in part due to the continued pass-through of labour and other costs. Nevertheless, the easing in pay growth that had been expected in the February Report appeared more evident in the latest indicators. The labour market had remained tight, and the news since the previous MPC meeting pointed to stronger-than-expected employment growth in 2023 Q2 and a flat rather than rising unemployment rate. The immediate policy decision 37: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 38: In the MPC’s February Monetary Policy Report projections, annual CPI inflation had been expected to fall back sharply towards the end of this year, alongside a much shallower projected decline in output than in the November Report forecast. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate at that time, an increasing degree of economic slack, alongside falling external pressures, would lead CPI inflation to decline to below the 2% target in the medium term. There were considerable uncertainties around this medium-term outlook, and the Committee had judged that the risks to inflation were skewed significantly to the upside. 39: Since the previous MPC meeting, there had been considerable news in global and domestic economic data relative to the near-term projections in the February Report. Global growth was expected to be stronger than projected, with GDP no longer being expected to contract in either China or the euro area in 2023 Q1. Core consumer price inflation in advanced economies had remained elevated. Wholesale gas futures and oil prices had fallen materially. 40: UK GDP was now expected to increase slightly in the second quarter, compared with the 0.4% decline anticipated in the February Report. The labour market had remained tight, with an unemployment rate of 3.7% in the three months to January and a rise in employment as a counterpart to a fall in the inactivity rate. The news since the MPC’s previous meeting pointed to stronger-than-expected employment growth in 2023 Q2 and a flat rather than rising unemployment rate. 41: Additional fiscal support had been announced in the Spring Budget. Bank staff had provisionally estimated that this could, relative to the February Report, increase the level of GDP by around 0.3% over coming years. A full assessment, including the extent to which these measures could affect supply as well as demand in the medium term, would be conducted ahead of the May Monetary Policy Report. 42: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen from 10.5% in December to 10.1% in January but had then risen to 10.4% in February, 0.6 percentage points higher than had been expected in the February Report. Services CPI inflation had been 6.6% in February, 0.1 percentage points weaker than had been expected at the time of the February Report, but food and core goods price inflation had been significantly stronger than projected. Most of the surprising strength in the core goods component was accounted for by higher clothing and footwear prices, which had tended to be volatile and could therefore prove less persistent. Annual private sector regular earnings growth had eased, to 7% in the three months to January, 0.1 percentage points below the expectation in February. Three month on three month growth in this measure of pay had fallen significantly in recent months. 43: CPI inflation was still expected to fall significantly in 2023 Q2, to a lower rate than had been anticipated in the February Report. This lower-than-expected rate was largely due to the near-term news in the Budget including on the Energy Price Guarantee, alongside the falls in wholesale energy prices since the previous MPC meeting. Services CPI inflation was expected to remain broadly unchanged in the near term, but wage growth was likely to fall back somewhat more quickly than had been projected in the February Report. 44: More generally, a lower path of energy prices would unwind further the terms of trade shock that households and businesses had been experiencing. The direct contribution of household energy prices to CPI inflation was now expected to turn negative by the end of this year, and this could also act to reduce inflation indirectly and via a dissipation of second-round effects. Lower energy prices would, however, boost activity, which, taken together with any other demand news pushing up GDP and employment, would, all else equal and over time, put upward pressure on inflation. 45: There had been large and volatile moves in global financial markets, in particular since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and in the run-up to UBS’s purchase of Credit Suisse, and reflecting market concerns about the possible broader impact of these events. Overall, government bond yields were broadly unchanged and risky asset prices were somewhat lower than at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting. 46: The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) had briefed the MPC about recent global banking sector developments. The FPC judged that the UK banking system maintained robust capital and strong liquidity positions, and was well placed to continue supporting the economy in a wide range of economic scenarios, including in a period of higher interest rates. The FPC’s assessment was that the UK banking system remained resilient. 47: Reflecting these developments, bank wholesale funding costs had risen in the United Kingdom and other advanced economies. The MPC would continue to monitor closely any effects on the credit conditions faced by households and businesses, and hence the impact on the macroeconomic and inflation outlook. 48: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy had been subject to a sequence of very large and overlapping shocks. Monetary policy would ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continued, CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. 49: Seven members judged that a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 4.25%, was warranted at this meeting. The considerable news since the previous MPC meeting could be evaluated in the framework for monitoring the persistence of inflationary pressures set out in the February minutes. Although nominal wage growth had been weaker than expected, the labour market had remained tight and the unemployment rate was now expected to be flat in 2023 Q2 rather than rising. Services CPI inflation had been broadly in line with expectations. Alongside these developments, headline CPI inflation had surprised significantly on the upside and the near-term path of GDP was likely to be somewhat stronger than expected previously. These members put some weight on the possibility that the stronger domestic and global outlook for demand was also being driven by factors over and above the weaker path of energy prices, given that the strengthening had at least in part preceded the falls in prices. Renewed and sustained demand for labour could still reinforce the persistence of higher costs in consumer prices, even if second-round effects related to energy price inflation were to diminish. 50: Two members preferred to leave Bank Rate unchanged at 4% at this meeting. As the effects of the energy price shock and other cost-push shocks unwound, headline CPI inflation should fall sharply over 2023, which would also reduce associated persistence in domestic price setting. At the same time, the lags in the effects of monetary policy meant that sizeable impacts from past rate increases were still to come through. That implied the current setting of Bank Rate would be likely to reduce inflation to well below target in the medium term. As the policy setting had become increasingly restrictive, this would bring forward the point at which recent rate increases would need to be reversed. 51: The extent to which domestic inflationary pressures eased would depend on the evolution of the economy, including the impact of the significant increases in Bank Rate so far. Uncertainties around the financial and economic outlook had risen. 52: The MPC would continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services inflation. If there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required. 53: The MPC would make a full assessment of all of the news since the February Report, including the economic implications of recent financial market and banking sector developments, as part of its forthcoming May forecast round. 54: The MPC would adjust Bank Rate as necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. 55: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%. 56: Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Silvana Tenreyro) voted against the proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 4%. Operational considerations 57: On 22 March 2023, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £826 billion, comprising £818 billion of UK government bond purchases and £7.7 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases. 58: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Swati Dhingra Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Silvana Tenreyro Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. 59: On the occasion of her final meeting, the Chair expressed his appreciation on behalf of the Committee to Clare Lombardelli for her role as Treasury representative since 2017. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 10 May will be published on 11 May 2023.

At its meeting ending on 10 May 2023, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.5%. Two members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%. The Committee’s updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying May Monetary Policy Report. They are conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that peaks at around 4¾% in 2023 Q4 before ending the forecast period at just over 3½%. There has been upside news to the near-term outlook for global activity, with UK-weighted world GDP now expected to grow at a moderate pace throughout the forecast period. Risks remain but, absent a further shock, there is likely to be only a small impact on GDP from the tightening of credit conditions related to recent global banking sector developments. Headline inflation has been falling in the United States and euro area, although core inflation measures remain elevated. UK GDP is expected to be flat over the first half of this year, although underlying output, excluding the estimated impact of strikes and an extra bank holiday, is projected to grow modestly. Economic activity has been less weak than expected in February, and the Committee now judges that the path of demand is likely to be materially stronger than expected in the February Report, albeit still subdued by historical standards. The improved outlook reflects stronger global growth, lower energy prices, the fiscal support in the Spring Budget, and the possibility that a tight labour market leads to lower precautionary saving by households. Although there are indications that the labour market has started to loosen, it is expected to remain tighter than in the February Report in the near term. The unemployment rate is now projected to remain below 4% until the end of 2024, before rising over the second half of the forecast period to around 4½%. CPI inflation was 10.2% in 2023 Q1, higher than expected at the time of the February and March MPC meetings, with the upside surprise concentrated in core goods and food prices. Although still elevated, nominal private sector wage growth and services CPI inflation have been close to expectations. CPI inflation is expected to fall sharply from April, in part as large rises in the price level one year ago drop out of the annual comparison. In addition, the extension in the Spring Budget of the Energy Price Guarantee and declines in wholesale energy prices will both lower the contribution from household energy bills to CPI inflation. However, food price inflation is likely to fall back more slowly than previously expected. Alongside news in other goods prices, this explains why the Committee’s modal expectation for CPI inflation now falls back more slowly than in the February Report. In the MPC’s latest modal projection conditioned on market interest rates, CPI inflation declines to a little above 1% at the two and three-year horizons, materially below the 2% target. This reflects the emergence of an increasing degree of economic slack and declining external pressures that are expected to reduce CPI inflation. However, there remain considerable uncertainties around the pace at which CPI inflation will return sustainably to the 2% target. The Committee continues to judge that the risks around the inflation forecast are skewed significantly to the upside, reflecting the possibility that the second-round effects of external cost shocks on inflation in wages and domestic prices may take longer to unwind than they did to emerge. The mean CPI inflation profile, which incorporates this risk, is at or just below the 2% target in the medium term. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has been subject to a sequence of very large and overlapping shocks. Monetary policy will ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continues, CPI inflation will return to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy is also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2% target. The Committee has voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.5%, at this meeting. In doing so the MPC is continuing to address the risk of more persistent strength in domestic price and wage setting, as represented by the upward skew in the projected distribution for CPI inflation. The pace at which domestic inflationary pressures ease will depend on the evolution of the economy, including the impact of the significant increases in Bank Rate so far. Uncertainties around the global financial and economic outlook remain elevated. The MPC will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price inflation. If there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required. The MPC will adjust Bank Rate as necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 10 May 2023 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying May 2023 Monetary Policy Report . 2: The latest international economic data suggested GDP growth had been stronger than the February 2023 Monetary Policy Report forecast across the United Kingdom’s main trading partners. The Committee noted that this had reflected different factors across regions. For instance, activity in China, particularly in the service sector, had surprised to the upside following the end of its zero-Covid policy. The euro-area economy had been more resilient than expected to the previous sharp rise in energy prices, while exports had been supported by stronger growth in China. In the United States, a robust labour market and higher post-tax income, following an increase in income tax thresholds that had come into effect from January, had been reflected in stronger-than-expected household consumption. In absolute terms, global output growth was nevertheless expected to remain somewhat weaker than its pre-pandemic average. The Committee also noted that headline inflation, while remaining elevated, had been falling in the United States and euro area, but core inflation measures had been flatter at high rates. 3: In addition to the latest developments in monetary and financial conditions, the Committee discussed the divergence in movements in UK and US market interest rates since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). While short-term interest rates in the United Kingdom had risen back to similar levels to those seen before the failure of SVB, those in the United States had remained at around the lower levels reached at the time of SVB’s failure. Market contacts had noted that this could, in part, be attributed to both UK-specific factors, such as CPI inflation having been higher than expected, and US-specific factors, where US credit conditions were expected to be somewhat tighter given stresses experienced by medium-sized US banks. 4: Following further signs of improvement in official estimates of UK activity and business surveys, Bank staff had increased their estimate of underlying quarterly GDP growth to around 0.2% during the first half of the year. The Committee discussed the potential factors behind the recent upside news in demand. While high energy and other tradable goods prices had depressed activity, these external shocks were beginning to abate and to a greater degree than assumed in previous forecasts that had been conditioned on higher prevailing commodities futures prices. Businesses and households also appeared to have been more resilient to the shocks that had crystallised, supported by fiscal policy. For households, spending had been further supported by the strength of the labour market and continuing employment growth, which had boosted incomes and may have reduced the extent of precautionary saving. 5: The Committee discussed how domestic inflationary pressures were evolving. Indicators of tightness, such as the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio and reported recruitment difficulties, continued to point to a loosening in the labour market, albeit they remained high by historical standards. Annual private sector regular pay growth had been close to expectations in recent months, consistent with an easing in higher-frequency pay growth data. But there continued to be a risk that pay growth could plateau at rates above those consistent with meeting the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term, if the labour market were to remain tight while households’ real incomes were still weak and short-term inflation expectations were elevated. Similarly, businesses might rebuild, and perhaps expand, their margins if demand were to remain firm. 6: Twelve-month CPI inflation had remained just above 10% in March, higher than expected in preceding forecasts. Although services CPI inflation had been in line with expectations, there had been material upside news within food and core goods prices. Food price inflation had reached a new historical high of close to 20%, and this component of the CPI basket was particularly salient for households and hence potentially for their inflation expectations more broadly. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents were expecting an easing in cost pressures associated with lower commodity prices and broader improvements in supply conditions to be passed on to consumer goods prices, but this would take some time to work through supply chains. The Committee judged that that process would be slower for food prices than had previously been anticipated. The immediate policy decision 7: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 8: Recent UK and global economic developments reinforced the MPC’s view at the time of its March meeting that economic activity had been more resilient than expected at the time of the February Report. Bank staff now expected underlying UK GDP to grow by around 0.2% in both 2023 Q1 and Q2, compared to expectations in the February Report of negative growth. There were indications that the labour market had started to loosen. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio had continued to fall, contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported that recruitment difficulties had eased and staff availability had increased in the latest KPMG/REC UK Report on Jobs. Nonetheless, the labour market was tighter than had been expected in February. Employment growth had been 0.5% in the three months to February, and was expected to be around 0.2% in 2023 Q2, both stronger than projected in the February Report. The unemployment rate was projected to be flat at 3.8% in Q2, compared to a projection of 4.1% in February. 9: Twelve-month CPI inflation had been higher than expected in 2023 Q1, at 10.2%, reflecting upside news in food and other goods price inflation, while services CPI inflation had been in line with expectations. Annual private sector regular pay growth had been 6.9% in the three months to February, close to the February Report forecast. The KPMG/REC permanent staff salaries index, which had tended to lead the ONS measure of private sector pay growth, had flattened in recent months, following a marked fall since last summer. Indicators of household and business UK inflation expectations had fallen back slightly, but most were still at elevated levels. 10: As set out in the accompanying May Monetary Policy Report, the MPC’s updated projections showed that CPI inflation was expected to fall sharply from April, in part as large price rises one year ago dropped out of the annual comparison. In addition, the extension in the Spring Budget of the Energy Price Guarantee and declines in wholesale energy prices would both lower the contribution from household energy bills to CPI inflation. However, updated staff analysis and reports from the Agents’ contacts suggested that food price inflation was likely to fall back more slowly than previously expected. Alongside news in other goods prices, this explained why the Committee’s modal expectation for CPI inflation now fell back more slowly than in the February Report. 11: Economic activity had been less weak than expected in February, and the Committee now judged that the path of demand was likely to be materially stronger than in the February Report, albeit still subdued by historical standards. The improved outlook reflected stronger global growth, lower energy prices, the fiscal support in the Spring Budget, and the possibility that a tight labour market would lead to lower precautionary saving by households. Given the lags in monetary policy transmission, the increases in Bank Rate since December 2021 were expected to have an increasing impact on the economy in the coming quarters. The unemployment rate was now projected to remain below 4% until the end of 2024, before rising over the second half of the forecast period to around 4½%. 12: In the MPC’s latest modal projection conditioned on market interest rates, CPI inflation declined to a little above 1% at the two and three-year horizons, materially below the 2% target. This reflected the emergence of an increasing degree of economic slack and declining external pressures that were expected to reduce CPI inflation. 13: However, there were considerable uncertainties around the pace at which CPI inflation would return sustainably to the 2% target. The Committee continued to judge that the risks to the inflation forecast were skewed significantly to the upside. Staff analysis had explored a range of channels that could be associated with more persistence in wage or price setting in the current environment. The Committee discussed the possibility that the second-round effects of external cost shocks on inflation in wages and domestic prices could take longer to unwind than they had to emerge. These risks were inherently difficult to quantify precisely, which had motivated the Committee’s choice to include them in the skew rather than the modal projection. The mean CPI inflation profile, which incorporated this risk, was at or just below the 2% target in the medium term. 14: The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) had continued to brief the MPC about recent banking sector developments. The FPC continued to judge that the UK banking system was resilient, maintaining robust capital and strong liquidity positions. It was resilient to the current economic outlook, and had the capacity to support the economy in a period of higher interest rates even if economic conditions were worse than forecast. The FPC was monitoring developments in other jurisdictions closely in light of the risk that indirect spillovers from overseas banks impacted the wider UK financial system. 15: The impact of recent global banking sector developments on domestic credit conditions and hence UK GDP was expected to be small. The MPC would continue to monitor closely any effects on the credit conditions faced by households and businesses. 16: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy had been subject to a sequence of very large and overlapping shocks. Monetary policy would ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continued, CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. 17: Seven members judged that a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 4.5%, was warranted at this meeting. It was important to continue to address the risk of more persistent strength in domestic price and wage setting, as represented by the upward skew in the projected distribution for CPI inflation. CPI inflation had been stronger than expected, owing to higher food and other goods prices, although services CPI inflation and wage growth, while still elevated, had been close to expectations. There were indications that the labour market had begun to loosen, but the path of unemployment was projected to be lower than in February. GDP growth had also been stronger than expected, and was expected to be higher over much of the forecast period than in February. For these members, there had been repeated surprises about the resilience of demand, while the labour market had remained tight. These were circumstances in which domestic price pressures risked becoming more persistent. In the May Report projections, CPI inflation was projected to take longer to return to the 2% target, conditioned on a higher path for Bank Rate. There remained a risk that the second-round effects of external cost shocks on inflation in wages and domestic prices could take longer to unwind than they had to emerge. A 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate would better manage the upside risks to the inflation outlook, in the context of a more prolonged return of inflation to target and materially stronger projected demand. 18: Two members preferred to leave Bank Rate unchanged at 4.25% at this meeting. As the effects of the energy price shock and other cost-push shocks unwound, headline CPI inflation should fall sharply over 2023, which would also reduce associated persistence in domestic price setting. At the same time, the lags in the effects of monetary policy meant that sizeable impacts from past rate increases were still to come through. That implied the current setting of Bank Rate would be likely to reduce inflation to well below target in the medium term. As the policy setting had become increasingly restrictive, this would bring forward the point at which recent rate increases would need to be reversed. 19: The pace at which domestic inflationary pressures eased would depend on the evolution of the economy, including the impact of the significant increases in Bank Rate so far. Uncertainties around the global financial and economic outlook remained elevated. 20: The MPC would continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price inflation. If there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required. 21: The MPC would adjust Bank Rate as necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. 22: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.5%. 23: Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Silvana Tenreyro) voted against the proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%. Operational considerations 24: On 10 May 2023, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £816 billion, comprising £813 billion of UK government bond purchases and £2.7 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases. 25: In February 2022, the MPC had voted to unwind fully the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases no earlier than towards the end of 2023. In December 2022, the Committee had noted that it was content with the initial rate of reduction in the stock which, if sustained, would permit an earlier unwind of the portfolio than originally anticipated. 26: Consistent with those indications, corporate bond sales had continued to progress and had been absorbed smoothly by the market. The sales programme was expected to conclude in coming weeks after which a small number of very short maturity bonds would continue to be held, as announced by the Bank at the outset of the sales programme, maturing fully by 5 April 2024. 27: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Swati Dhingra Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Silvana Tenreyro James Bowler was present as the Treasury representative. 28: As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, David Roberts was also present on 2 and 4 May, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 21 June will be published on 22 June 2023.

At its meeting ending on 21 June 2023, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 5%. Two members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.5%. At the time of the previous MPC meeting and May Monetary Policy Report, the market-implied path for Bank Rate averaged just over 4% over the next three years. Since then, gilt yields have risen materially, particularly at shorter maturities, now suggesting a path for Bank Rate that averages around 5½%. Mortgage rates have also risen notably. The sterling effective exchange rate has appreciated further. The Committee is continuing to monitor closely the impact of the significant increases in Bank Rate so far. As set out in the May Report, the greater share of fixed-rate mortgages means that the full impact of the increase in Bank Rate to date will not be felt for some time. Business surveys continue to suggest underlying quarterly GDP growth of around ¼% during the middle of this year. Indicators of household spending have tended to strengthen a little. LFS employment increased by 0.8% in the three months to April, higher than expected at the time of the May Report. The counterpart to this strong employment growth has been a further fall in the inactivity rate. The unemployment rate has been flat at 3.8%, in line with the May Report. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio has fallen further but remains significantly elevated. Annual growth in private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) increased to 7.6% in the three months to April, 0.5 percentage points above the expectation at the time of the May Report. Three-month on three-month growth in this measure of pay has also picked up. Indications of future pay growth from the KPMG/REC survey and the Bank’s Agents suggest that AWE growth will ease over the rest of this year, however. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell from 10.1% in March to 8.7% in April and remained at that rate in May. This is 0.3 percentage points higher than expected in the May Report. Services CPI inflation rose to 7.4% in May, 0.5 percentage points stronger than expected at the time of the May Report, while core goods price inflation has also been much stronger than projected. In general, news in the latter component is less likely to imply persistent inflationary pressures. CPI inflation is expected to fall significantly further during the course of the year, in the main reflecting developments in energy prices. Services CPI inflation is projected to remain broadly unchanged in the near term. Core goods CPI inflation is expected to decline later this year, supported by developments in cost and price indicators earlier in the supply chain. In particular, annual producer output price inflation has fallen very sharply in recent months. Food price inflation is projected to fall further in coming months. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. The MPC recognises that the second-round effects in domestic price and wage developments generated by external cost shocks are likely to take longer to unwind than they did to emerge. There has been significant upside news in recent data that indicates more persistence in the inflation process, against the background of a tight labour market and continued resilience in demand. At this meeting, the Committee voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 5%. The MPC will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures in the economy as a whole, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price inflation. If there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required. The MPC will adjust Bank Rate as necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 21 June 2023 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: UK-weighted global GDP growth in 2023 Q2 was expected to be marginally stronger than anticipated at the time of the May Monetary Policy Report, following a slightly weaker-than-expected outturn for Q1. The most acute risks from recent global banking sector stresses appeared to have faded. Following the end of its zero-Covid policy in December 2022, growth momentum in China appeared to have slowed in Q2, in line with expectations at the time of the May Report. Recent weakness in Chinese tradable goods prices could start to put downward pressure on world export price inflation. 3: Labour markets had remained tight in both the euro area and the United States, with unemployment rates remaining close to their historically low levels alongside flat or rising labour participation rates, elevated but declining vacancies-to-unemployment ratios and strong wage pressure. This continued labour market tightness could have contributed to elevated services price inflation in both regions. 4: European wholesale spot and futures gas prices had been relatively volatile given changes in long-range weather forecasts and disruptions in supplies from Norway, but had ended the period since the MPC’s previous meeting little changed. The Brent crude oil spot price had declined by around 3% since the MPC’s previous meeting to around $75 per barrel. Agricultural commodity prices had been broadly unchanged. 5: Headline consumer price inflation had continued to decline in the euro area and the United States. Annual euro-area HICP inflation had decreased to 6.1% in May from 7.0% in April, accounted for mainly by continued falls in energy price inflation. The decline in annual core HICP inflation had been less pronounced as services price inflation had remained high while core goods price inflation had continued to decline gradually. In the United States, headline CPI inflation had fallen by 0.9 percentage points in May, to 4.0%, which was consistent with annual PCE inflation having declined to 3.8%. Within CPI inflation, while both core goods and services inflation had remained broadly at their April levels, core goods inflation was significantly below its 2022 peak. Monetary and financial conditions 6: At its meeting ending on 14 June, the Federal Open Market Committee had left the federal funds rate unchanged and, at its meeting ending on 15 June, the ECB Governing Council had raised its key policy rates by 25 basis points, both in line with market expectations. In the United Kingdom, the market path implied that Bank Rate would be around 4.8% following this meeting, and would now average around 5½% over the next three years, compared to just over 4% in the conditioning assumption underpinning the May Monetary Policy Report. 7: There had been a material increase in both shorter and longer-term government bond yields globally, which had been particularly pronounced in the United Kingdom. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, the one-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate, one year forward had increased by around 40, 80 and 140 basis points respectively in the euro area, United States and United Kingdom, and the 10-year government bond yield had increased by around 5, 25 and 55 basis points respectively in Germany, the United States and United Kingdom. 8: The Committee discussed the possible drivers of the increases in interest rates. There had been some positive news from data in the United States, and from the resolution of US debt ceiling negotiations, while downside risks related to the banking sector stress seen in March 2023 were perceived to have receded somewhat. These factors had had an impact globally. 9: The movements in UK rates had been much larger than in other major advanced economies, leaving the UK OIS curve both higher and flatter than its US and euro-area counterparts. In part, this had reflected some news about the continued resilience of UK demand. To a greater degree, it had appeared to reflect an increase in market participants’ expectations of UK inflation persistence. The median respondent to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS), which had been conducted before the latest UK labour market and CPI releases, now expected CPI inflation one and three years ahead to be 3.1% and 2.2% respectively, compared with 2.7% and 2.0% in the previous survey in May. 10: There was some evidence that market pricing had been more sensitive to economic data outturns than had been usual over the past decade. Recent data releases had been accompanied by larger movements in the OIS curve than surprises of a similar magnitude had generated previously, notably in response to the material upside surprises in recent UK data releases on CPI inflation and the labour market. MaPS respondents had cited the evolution of wage growth, labour market tightness and services price inflation as the most important indicators when forming their expectations for the evolution of UK monetary policy, in line with the MPC’s recent communications. 11: Medium-term inflation compensation measures in the United Kingdom, United States and euro area had increased a little further since the MPC’s previous meeting. Although interpreting the movements in UK medium-term inflation compensation measures continued to be challenging, these measures were materially lower than their peak in March 2022, while remaining above their average levels of the previous decade. MaPS respondents’ expectations of CPI inflation five years ahead had remained unchanged since the May survey, at 2.0%. 12: The sterling effective exchange rate had appreciated further, and had ended the period around 2% higher than at the time of the MPC’s previous meeting and around 6% higher than at the beginning of 2023. UK-focused equity prices had fallen by around 3% since the MPC’s previous meeting, in contrast to an increase in major equity indices in the United States and euro area. 13: UK owner-occupied fixed-term mortgage rates had picked up materially since the MPC’s previous meeting, following a period of decline in recent months. This had largely reflected the pass-through of increases in risk-free reference rates. The market-share weighted average quoted rate on a two-year fixed-rate 75% loan-to-value mortgage had increased by around 90 basis points since the May MPC meeting, to 5.6%, and the five-year equivalent had increased by around 80 basis points, to 5.1%. There had been a net decline in the number of owner-occupied mortgage products available to borrowers since the MPC’s previous meeting. 14: Net secured lending to households had decreased somewhat further in April, with, unusually, net outflows of £1.4 billion, compared to roughly zero in March. Mortgage approvals for house purchase had also fallen in April, to 48,700, but had remained above the average level of the previous six months. 15: Deposit rates had increased broadly in line with previous trends seen in this cycle. Time deposit rates had moved up materially since the MPC’s previous meeting, in response to higher reference rates, while sight deposit rates had risen by much less. Reflecting these relative movements in remuneration, there had been a shift in deposit volumes from instant access accounts towards time deposits over the previous six months. Such substitution was internalised within the flow of overall sterling broad money, which had grown at an annual rate of 1.6% in April, up slightly from 1.4% in March. Demand and output 16: According to the ONS’s first quarterly estimate, real GDP had increased by 0.1% in 2023 Q1, marginally stronger than had been expected in the May Monetary Policy Report. Household consumption had also risen by 0.1%, while business investment had been estimated to have increased by 0.7%. Housing investment had fallen by 2.5% in Q1, leaving the level 5.5% lower than in 2022 Q3. 17: Monthly GDP had increased by 0.2% in April, following a 0.3% fall in March, and leaving it close to its pre-pandemic level. Market sector output had also risen by 0.2% in April and had been on a rising trend over recent months, in contrast to the flatter profile of overall GDP. That divergence was in part likely to reflect the impact of strike activity on the volume of public sector output. 18: Business surveys continued to suggest an underlying pace of quarterly GDP growth of around ¼% in 2023 Q2. After taking account of the impact of idiosyncratic factors, including the additional bank holiday in May, Bank staff expected headline GDP to be flat in the second quarter, in line with the projection in the May Report. 19: The outlook for 2023 Q3 was more uncertain, but Bank staff continued to judge that an underlying quarterly growth rate of around ¼% was a reasonable central projection. This would be consistent with stronger headline GDP growth than in Q2 as the impact of idiosyncratic factors unwound. The Bank’s Agents had noted a slight pickup in the outlook for underlying activity in 2023 H2, while the S&P Global/CIPS UK composite PMI output expectations index also pointed to some further increase in underlying growth momentum. 20: Most indicators of household spending had tended to strengthen a little over recent months, albeit from very weak levels in some cases. Quarterly retail sales volumes had grown for the first time in 18 months, while consumer confidence had continued to pick up. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported that consumer demand had been more resilient than they had expected across both goods and services. The increase in mortgage rates so far during this cycle had, however, already led to higher aggregate interest payments by households, and this metric was likely to rise further. Supply, costs and prices 21: Labour Force Survey (LFS) employment had increased by 0.8% in the three months to April, 0.2 percentage points higher than had been expected at the time of the May Monetary Policy Report. Rather than a decline in unemployment, the counterpart to this strong employment growth had been a further fall in the 16+ population’s inactivity rate, particularly amongst students, which had reached its lowest level since spring 2020. HMRC PAYE employee payrolls and the S&P Global/CIPS UK PMI composite employment index had continued to point to employment growth being somewhat softer than LFS-based estimates. 22: Some measures of labour market tightness had continued to ease, but overall the labour market had remained tight by historical standards. The LFS unemployment rate had been broadly flat, at 3.8%, in the three months to April, consistent with the expectation at the time of the May Report. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio had fallen further in the three months to April, to its lowest level since October 2021, but was still significantly elevated compared to pre-Covid levels. The number of job-to-job flows had declined again in 2023 Q1, to just above the level observed pre-Covid. Recruitment and employment consultancies responding to the KPMG/REC survey had indicated that overall staff availability had continued to improve in May. The Bank’s Agents’ contacts had reported that recruitment difficulties had continued to ease, but overall recruitment had still been more difficult than normal. 23: Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth had increased by 0.5 percentage points to 7.6% in the three months to April, 0.5 percentage points above the expectation at the time of the May Report. The pick-up in annual pay growth since the time of the May Report had been concentrated in higher-paying sectors such as financial and business services. Pay growth in lower-paid sectors like wholesaling, retailing, hotels and restaurants had been broadly flat. Three-month on three-month growth in private sector regular pay had been strong, rising to an annualised rate of around 8% in April, from 6.3% in March, contrasting notably with the falling growth rates between July 2022 and February 2023. 24: There had nevertheless been some countervailing signs of softening pay growth. The KPMG/REC survey measure of pay for new permanent hires, which had historically led AWE pay growth by around a year, had declined in May, having been broadly stable at a lower level since October 2022. This indicator pointed to a risk of private sector regular pay growth easing by more than had been expected in the May Report over the rest of this year. Some of the Bank’s Agents’ contacts had reported that pay settlements in the second half of this year could be somewhat lower than in the first half, largely due to lower near-term inflation expectations, with a looser labour market also expected to play a role. 25: At 8.7%, twelve-month CPI inflation in May had been unchanged from April. This release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. The May figure was 0.3 percentage points higher than the expectation at the time of the May Report. 26: The upside CPI news since the May Report had been concentrated in core components, with core goods accounting for the majority of this news. Within core goods, for which the inflation rate had risen to 6.8% in May, the purchase of vehicles and recreational goods had accounted for the majority of this news. The surprise strength in vehicle prices had appeared to be related to a temporary supply shortage of 2-3 year old used cars, reflecting the lack of car production owing to the earlier semi-conductor shortage and coinciding with the age range of used cars for which the ONS collected prices. Non-energy goods import prices had risen further, suggesting that core goods manufacturers and retailers still faced high costs. Bank staff analysis suggested that world export prices could account for a significant share of elevated core goods CPI inflation. 27: Services CPI inflation had risen from 6.9% in April to 7.4% in May, 0.5 percentage points stronger than had been expected in the May Report, and partly reflecting a sharp rise in measured Vehicle Excise Duty rates. Airfares and package holidays had also accounted for some of the upside news. Airfares were a volatile component of the basket and the news in May had appeared to reflect the timing of Easter in April. 28: Food CPI inflation had edged down to 18.3% in May. The softening of annual food price inflation in the United Kingdom appeared to have followed developments in euro-area countries, albeit with somewhat of a lag, consistent with the global nature of recent shocks to food prices. 29: CPI inflation was expected to fall significantly further during the course of the year, in the main reflecting developments in energy prices. Energy prices were expected to drag on CPI inflation even further in October, due largely to the resetting of the Ofgem price cap faced by households at that time. There was still considerable uncertainty around the outlook for household energy prices, however, as only around a third of the relevant observation window for the October price cap had passed so far. 30: Core goods inflation was expected to remain elevated in the near term. Indicators of manufacturing cost pressures had nevertheless continued to ease. Producer price index (PPI) input and output price inflation had moderated to 0.5% and 2.9% respectively in May, broadly consistent with developments in the United States and euro area. Core goods CPI inflation had diverged from manufacturing PPI inflation recently, whereas historically these series had shown strong co-movement. The possibility of a reassertion of this historical association in the near term posed a downside risk to the outlook for core goods CPI inflation. 31: The continued pass-through of service providers’ costs, including labour costs, was expected to keep services price inflation elevated in the near term. The Bank’s Agents’ consumer services contacts had reported that, while they had absorbed some, a fair proportion of cost increases had been passed on to consumer prices. 32: Food CPI inflation was expected to ease in the near term, reflecting the waning of pass-through from previous shocks and the recent fall-back in cost inflation further up the food supply chain. 33: Households and businesses’ short-term inflation expectations had eased further but had remained somewhat above their historical averages. Households’ median one-year inflation expectations, as measured by both the Bank/Ipsos and Citi/YouGov surveys, had fallen. The Decision Maker Panel survey suggested that businesses’ expectations for their own prices a year ahead had also declined, to around 5% in May. 34: Households’ median medium-term inflation expectations had been close to their historical averages in the latest releases of the major surveys. The Bank/Ipsos 5-year ahead measure had been below its pre-Covid average for a second successive quarter. The Citi/YouGov 5-10 year ahead measure had fallen to 3.5%, less than one standard deviation above its pre-Covid average. The immediate policy decision 35: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 36: The Committee’s latest projections for activity and inflation had been set out in the May Monetary Policy Report and had been conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that had averaged just over 4% over the next three years. In the modal case, CPI inflation had been expected to decline to a little above 1% at the two and three-year horizons, materially below the 2% target. This had reflected the projected emergence of an increasing degree of economic slack and declining external pressures that had been expected to reduce CPI inflation. However, the Committee had continued to judge that the risks around this inflation projection were skewed significantly to the upside, reflecting the potential for more persistent strength in domestic price and wage setting. 37: Since the previous MPC meeting, there had been material news in a number of UK economic data outturns, including those that the Committee had noted it would be monitoring closely as indicators of persistent inflationary pressures. 38: LFS employment had increased by 0.8% in the three months to April, higher than had been expected at the time of the May Report. The counterpart to this strong employment growth had been a further fall in the inactivity rate. The unemployment rate had been flat at 3.8%, in line with the May Report. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio had fallen further but remained significantly elevated. 39: Annual growth in private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had increased to 7.6% in the three months to April, 0.5 percentage points above the expectation at the time of the May Report. Indications of future pay growth from the KPMG/REC survey and the Bank’s Agents suggested that AWE growth would ease over the rest of this year, however. 40: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen from 10.1% in March to 8.7% in April and had remained at that rate in May. This was 0.3 percentage points higher than had been expected in the May Report. Services CPI inflation had risen to 7.4% in May, 0.5 percentage points stronger than had been expected at the time of the May Report. 41: CPI inflation was expected to fall significantly further during the course of the year, in the main reflecting developments in energy prices. Services CPI inflation was projected to remain broadly unchanged in the near term. Core goods CPI inflation was expected to decline later this year, supported by developments in cost and price indicators earlier in the supply chain. In particular, annual producer output price inflation had fallen very sharply in recent months. Food price inflation was projected to fall further in coming months. 42: The Committee was continuing to monitor closely the impact of the significant increases in Bank Rate so far. As set out in the May Report, the greater share of fixed-rate mortgages meant that the full impact of the increase in Bank Rate to date would not be felt for some time. The Committee also recognised that it had become more important to consider developments in the rental market. 43: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation departed from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy would ensure that CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. 44: Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. Households and businesses’ short-term inflation expectations had eased further but had remained somewhat above their historical averages. Households’ median medium-term inflation expectations had been close to their historical averages in the latest releases of the major surveys. UK medium-term inflation compensation measures in financial markets had increased a little further since the MPC’s previous meeting and were above their average levels of the previous decade. 45: Seven members judged that a 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 5%, was warranted at this meeting. The second-round effects in domestic price and wage developments generated by external cost shocks were likely to take longer to unwind than they had done to emerge. There had been significant upside news in recent data that indicated more persistence in the inflation process, against the background of a tight labour market and continued resilience in demand. Some indicators of future pay growth and goods inflation had weakened, but their properties as leading indicators had not been tested in a similar period of high inflation. The scale of the recent upside surprises in official estimates of wage growth and services CPI inflation suggested a 0.5 percentage point increase in interest rates was required at this particular meeting. 46: Two members preferred to leave Bank Rate unchanged at 4.5% at this meeting. There were two main factors underlying their votes. First, as the energy price shock and other global cost-push shocks continued to reverse over the course of 2023, goods price inflation should fall sharply, which, with some lag, would reduce associated persistence in domestic wage and price setting . In contrast with the strength in recent outturns, forward-looking indicators were pointing to material falls in future wage and price inflation. Second, the lags in the effects of monetary policy meant that sizable impacts from past rate increases were still to come through. This included additional rate increases carried out in recent months, which would more than offset any additional persistence implied by the latest data. The current setting of Bank Rate would therefore be likely to reduce inflation below target in the medium term. Recent substantial increases in market yields would accentuate this, as they would mainly affect inflation in late 2024 and beyond, by which point energy price falls from their peaks and past rate rises would have lowered inflation significantly. 47: The MPC would continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures in the economy as a whole, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price inflation. If there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required. 48: The MPC would adjust Bank Rate as necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. 49: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.5 percentage points, to 5%. 50: Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Silvana Tenreyro) voted against the proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 4.5%. Operational considerations 51: On 21 June 2023, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £806 billion, comprising £805 billion of UK government bond purchases and £0.8 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases. 52: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Swati Dhingra Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Silvana Tenreyro Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. 53: On behalf of the Committee, the Chair expressed his appreciation to Silvana Tenreyro for her contributions to the work of the MPC since becoming a member in 2017. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 2 August will be published on 3 August 2023.

At its meeting ending on 2 August 2023, the MPC voted by a majority of 6–3 to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.25%. Two members preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 5.5%, and one member preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 5%. The Committee’s updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report. These are conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rises to a peak of just over 6% and averages just under 5½% over the three-year forecast period, compared with an average of just over 4% for the equivalent period at the time of the May Report. The sterling effective exchange rate is around 4% higher than in the May Report. Underlying quarterly GDP growth has been around 0.2% during the first half of this year. Bank staff expect a similar growth rate in the near term, reflecting more resilient household income and retail sales volumes, and most business surveys over recent months. Some more recent indicators show signs of weakening, however, including the July S&P Global/CIPS UK composite PMI. The labour market remains tight but there are some indications that it is loosening. The LFS unemployment rate rose to 4.0% in the three months to May, somewhat higher than expected in the May Report, and the vacancies to unemployment ratio has continued to fall, although the latter still remains above historical averages. Annual private sector regular pay growth increased to 7.7% in the three months to May, materially above expectations at the time of the May Report, and three-month on three-month growth in this measure of pay has picked up further. Earnings growth is nevertheless expected to decline in coming quarters, to around 6% by the end of this year, although there is uncertainty around this near-term outlook. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell from 8.7% in May to 7.9% in June, lower than expected at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting. Within this, core goods and services CPI inflation were both lower than expected, although the downside news in the latter, which is more likely to be informative about persistent inflationary pressures, was much smaller. Compared to the May Report projections, June CPI inflation was in line with expectations. CPI inflation remains well above the 2% target. It is expected to fall significantly further, to around 5% by the end of the year, accounted for by lower energy, and to a lesser degree, food and core goods price inflation. Services price inflation, however, is projected to remain elevated at close to its current rate in the near term. In the MPC’s August most likely, or modal, projection conditioned on market interest rates, CPI inflation returns to the 2% target by 2025 Q2. It then falls below the target in the medium term, as an increasing degree of economic slack reduces domestic inflationary pressures, alongside declining external cost pressures. The Committee has decided in this forecast to bring some of the upside risks to inflation from persistence into its modal projection, pushing up on this inflation projection in the medium term relative to the May Report. The Committee continues to judge that risks around the modal inflation forecast are skewed to the upside, albeit by less than in May, reflecting the possibility that the second-round effects of external cost shocks on inflation in wages and domestic prices take longer to unwind than they did to emerge. Mean CPI inflation, which incorporates these risks, is 2.0% and 1.9% at the two and three-year horizons respectively. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Recent data outturns have been mixed. However, some key indicators, notably wage growth, suggest that some of the risks from more persistent inflationary pressures may have begun to crystallise. At this meeting, the Committee voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.25%. Given the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of this tightening cycle, the current monetary policy stance is restrictive. The MPC will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price inflation. If there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required. The MPC will ensure that Bank Rate is sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 2 August 2023 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying August 2023 Monetary Policy Report . 2: The Committee discussed how inflation was evolving in other advanced economies, including in the euro area and the United States. Headline consumer price inflation had decreased significantly in these economies as commodity prices and energy prices had fallen back, and supply chain bottlenecks had dissipated. Core inflation had already peaked in the United States and appeared to be peaking in the euro area. Consumer goods price inflation was declining but services price inflation had remained strong. Several central banks had tightened monetary policy further and had noted that policy was dampening economic activity. 3: While UK-weighted global growth had proven resilient, some slowing was evident. For example, interest-sensitive components of demand such as housing investment in the United States, and housing and business investment in the euro area, had shown signs of weakness. Consumer spending, at least in the United States, had been more resilient, supported by the build-up of savings during the pandemic and the robustness of the labour market. 4: Advanced-economy labour markets generally remained tight, although the vacancies to unemployment ratio and wage growth in the United States had both started to fall. Wage growth remained strong in the euro area. It remained to be seen how quickly the more persistent components of inflation would fall back across economies, and there was a risk that underlying inflationary pressures could continue to persist even as headline measures fell towards their targets. 5: Regarding the latest developments in monetary and financial conditions, the Committee discussed evidence that interest rates in financial markets had been more sensitive to economic data outturns, particularly in the United Kingdom, than had been usual over the past decade. Market participants appeared to have placed more weight than usual on data outturns as leading indicators of inflation persistence. In the United Kingdom, respondents to the Bank’s Market Participants Survey had continued to cite the evolution of wage growth, labour market tightness and services price inflation as the most important indicators when forming their expectations for the evolution of UK monetary policy, in line with the MPC’s recent communications. Nevertheless, some of these series could be volatile from month to month. 6: The Committee discussed the near-term outlook for UK economic activity. Bank staff expected underlying quarterly GDP growth of 0.2% in 2023 Q2 and Q3, consistent with expectations at the time of the May Report. There had been continued resilience in household spending, supported by strength in both labour market activity and nominal wage growth, and consistent with a number of business surveys over recent months. 7: Set against that, the Committee noted that July indicators had been more mixed. There had been a decline in the flash S&P Global/CIPS UK composite PMI, which could be an early sign of less resilient growth, and lower consumer confidence. A greater number of contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported a slowing in the outlook for activity in the most recent period. Recent increases in market interest rates, and the subsequent media coverage of increasing mortgage costs, could have also contributed to the movements in these indicators. 8: The Committee discussed the balance in the economic outlook between the impact of higher rates weighing on consumer spending and business investment, against the upside impact on incomes from subsiding energy and food prices. Taken together, these factors suggested modestly positive underlying output growth for the second half of the year. 9: The Committee discussed recent news on indicators of UK inflation persistence. There were some signs that the labour market was loosening, although it remained tight in absolute terms. The LFS unemployment rate had risen to 4.0% in the three months to May, the vacancies to unemployment ratio had continued to decline, and recruitment difficulties appeared to be easing somewhat. However, annual private sector regular pay growth had increased further in May, and was materially stronger than had been expected in the May Report. Three-month on three-month growth in this measure of pay had picked up further. 10: Recent outturns in pay growth appeared to have been stronger than a standard model, based on productivity, short-term inflation expectations and a measure of economic slack, would have predicted. This could indicate greater second-round effects from the rise in inflation on wage growth after the terms of trade shock that had affected the economy. This suggested that the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment was likely to be higher. Wage growth was expected to remain strong in the near term, with the risk that there could be further upside surprises. Set against that, developments in some forward-looking indicators, such as the KPMG/REC UK Report on Jobs, implied that wage growth could slow more sharply than anticipated in the second half of 2023, although that survey’s relationship with official earnings growth appeared to have weakened recently. 11: Twelve-month CPI inflation had eased to 7.9% in June, in line with the projection in the May Report, and reflecting a falling contribution from energy and, to a lesser extent, food prices. However, both core goods and services CPI inflation had been stronger than expected at the time of the May Report. Elevated goods price inflation continued to be broad-based across products, but slowing producer price inflation suggested that it could ease significantly towards the end of 2023. Services CPI inflation was projected to remain elevated in the near term. The MPC noted that its strength was likely to reflect resilience in demand, the strength of nominal pay growth and, to some extent, non-labour input costs, although some of the upside surprise had reflected components of services prices in which more idiosyncratic factors were likely to be at play. The immediate policy decision 12: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 13: The Committee discussed the evolution of key economic indicators since its previous meeting and the degree to which they had shown continued resilience. Underlying quarterly GDP growth had been around 0.2% during the first half of this year. Bank staff expected a similar growth rate in the near term, reflecting more resilient household income and retail sales volumes, and most business surveys over recent months. Some more recent indicators had shown signs of weakening, however, including the July S&P Global/CIPS UK composite PMI. 14: The labour market remained tight, but there were some indications that it was loosening. The LFS unemployment rate had risen to 4.0% in the three months to May and the vacancies to unemployment ratio had continued to fall, although the latter still remained above historical averages. 15: Annual private sector regular pay growth had increased to 7.7% in the three months to May, and three-month on three-month growth in this measure of pay had picked up further. Earnings growth was nevertheless expected to decline in coming quarters, to around 6% by the end of this year, although there was uncertainty around this near-term outlook. 16: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen from 8.7% in May to 7.9% in June, lower than expected at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting. Within this, core goods and services CPI inflation had both been lower than expected, although the downside news in the latter, which was more likely to be informative about persistent inflationary pressures, had been much smaller. 17: As set out in the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report, CPI inflation was expected to fall significantly further, to around 5% by the end of the year, accounted for by lower energy, and to a lesser degree, food and core goods price inflation. Services price inflation, however, was projected to remain elevated at close to its current rate in the near term. 18: Past increases in Bank Rate, and the higher path of market interest rates on which the August Report forecast was conditioned, were expected to increasingly weigh on UK activity and inflation in coming quarters. Relative to the May projection, quarterly GDP growth was expected to be weaker throughout much of the forecast period, particularly during 2024 and at the beginning of 2025. An increasing degree of economic slack was expected to emerge after the middle of next year and the unemployment rate was projected to rise to just under 5% by 2026 Q3. Both aggregate spare capacity and unemployment increased by somewhat more in the Committee’s latest projections than in the May Report, reflecting the weaker path of GDP. 19: In the MPC’s August most likely, or modal, projection conditioned on market interest rates, CPI inflation returned to the 2% target by 2025 Q2. It then fell below the target in the medium term, as an increasing degree of economic slack reduced domestic inflationary pressures, alongside declining external cost pressures. The Committee had decided in this forecast to bring some of the upside risks to inflation from persistence into its modal projection, pushing up on this inflation projection in the medium term relative to the May Report. 20: The Committee continued to judge that the risks around the modal inflation forecast were skewed to the upside, albeit by less than in May, reflecting the possibility that the second-round effects of external cost shocks on inflation in wages and domestic prices might take longer to unwind than they did to emerge. Mean CPI inflation, which incorporated these risks, was 2.0% and 1.9% at the two and three-year horizons respectively. 21: The MPC noted that the significant increases in Bank Rate since December 2021, and the move up across the yield curve as a whole over the same period, had tightened the overall stance of monetary policy, restricting demand relative to supply. These effects were likely to continue to build over coming quarters, as was shown in the MPC's August modal and mean projections. 22: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy would ensure that CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. 23: Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. Most indicators of household and corporate inflation expectations had tended to decline since the MPC’s previous meeting, while medium-term inflation compensation measures in financial markets had risen slightly and had remained above their long-term averages. 24: Six members judged that a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 5.25%, was warranted at this meeting. Recent data outturns had been mixed. However, some key indicators, notably wage growth, had surprised significantly on the upside. This could indicate that the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment had risen, and that some of the risks of greater persistence in broader domestic inflationary pressures had crystallised. Set against that, the unemployment rate had increased a little and the vacancies to unemployment ratio had decreased further since the previous MPC meeting. The most recent indicators of slowing activity needed to be weighed against the surprising resilience of activity over a number of quarters, and it was too early to conclude that the economy was at or very close to a significant turning point. Although the monetary stance was weighing on economic activity, a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate at this meeting was necessary to address the risks from greater inflation persistence. 25: Two members judged that a 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 5.5%, was warranted at this meeting. For these members, it was important to lean more actively against inflation persistence, which, as described in the August Report, successive forecasts had under-predicted. These members noted the continued tightness in the labour market: while the vacancies to unemployment ratio was falling, it was still well above long-run average levels. Further, high-frequency private sector wage growth measures had continued to trend upwards, consistent with the possibility that the equilibrium unemployment rate had risen. Key metrics including both core and services CPI inflation had continued to remain high. For these members, a forceful increase in Bank Rate at this meeting would help to bring inflation back to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, and to reduce the risks of a more costly tightening later. 26: One member preferred to leave Bank Rate unchanged at 5% at this meeting. As the policy stance had become increasingly restrictive, there was no longer a strong case for further tightening on risk management grounds. Instead, the risks of overtightening had continued to build, increasing the likelihood of output losses and volatility that would require sharper reversals of policy. Lags in the effects of monetary policy meant that sizeable impacts from past and recent rate increases were still to come through, particularly from cumulative impacts on housing costs. Recent news in components of consumer and producer price inflation strongly indicated a downward trajectory for CPI inflation. Wage inflation had been strongest in business services, while real wages had fallen in most other industries, covering three-quarters of all employees. Given the restrictive policy stance, pay growth was likely to slow as inflation in salient items eased over this year and as the labour market continued to loosen further. 27: Given the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of this tightening cycle, the current monetary policy stance was restrictive. The MPC would continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price inflation. If there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required. The MPC would ensure that Bank Rate was sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. 28: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be increased by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.25%. 29: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Megan Greene, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members voted against the proposition. Two members (Jonathan Haskel and Catherine L Mann) preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 5.5%. Swati Dhingra preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 5%. Operational considerations 30: On 2 August 2023, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £786 billion, comprising £785 billion of UK government bond purchases and £0.8 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases. 31: As discussed in Box A in the August Monetary Policy Report, the Committee would vote on the target for gilt stock reduction over the 12-month period from October 2023 to September 2024 at its September 2023 meeting. 32: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. 33: As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, David Roberts was also present on 26 and 28 July, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 20 September will be published on 21 September 2023.

At its meeting ending on 20 September 2023, the MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Four members preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. The Committee also voted unanimously to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes, and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £100 billion over the next twelve months, to a total of £658 billion. In the MPC’s August most likely, or modal, Monetary Policy Report projections, conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that averaged just under 5½% over the three-year forecast period, CPI inflation was expected to return to the 2% target by 2025 Q2. It was then projected to fall below the target in the medium term, as an increasing degree of economic slack was expected to reduce domestic inflationary pressures, alongside declining external cost pressures. The Committee had continued to judge that the risks around the modal inflation forecast were skewed to the upside, albeit by less than in May, reflecting the possibility that the second-round effects of external cost shocks on inflation in wages and domestic prices take longer to unwind than they did to emerge. The mean projection for CPI inflation, which incorporated these risks, was 2.0% and 1.9% at the two and three-year horizons respectively. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, global growth has evolved broadly in line with the August Report projections, albeit with some differences across regions. Spot oil prices have risen significantly, while underlying inflationary pressures have remained elevated across advanced economies. UK GDP is estimated to have declined by 0.5% in July and the S&P Global/CIPS composite output PMI fell in August, although other business survey indicators remain consistent with positive GDP growth. While some of this news could prove erratic, Bank staff now expect GDP to rise only slightly in 2023 Q3. Underlying growth in the second half of 2023 is also likely to be weaker than expected. There have been some further signs of a loosening in the labour market, although it remains tight by historical standards. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio has continued to decline, reflecting both a steady fall in the number of vacancies and rising unemployment. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in the three months to July, higher than expected in the August Report. Indicators of employment have generally softened against the backdrop of subdued activity. Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth increased to 8.1% in the three months to July, 0.8 percentage points above the August Report projection. The recent path of the AWE is, however, difficult to reconcile with other indicators of pay growth. Most of these have tended to be more stable at rates of growth that are elevated but not quite as high as the AWE series. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell from 7.9% in June to 6.7% in August, 0.4 percentage points below expectations at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting, and triggering the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that is being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Core goods CPI inflation has fallen from 6.4% in June to 5.2% in August, much weaker than expected in the August Report. Services CPI inflation rose from 7.2% in June to 7.4% in July but declined to 6.8% in August, 0.3 percentage points lower than expected in the August Report. Some of those movements are linked to services such as airfares and accommodation that tend to be volatile over the summer holiday period. Excluding these travel-related components, services inflation has been more stable at continued high rates, albeit slightly weaker than expected. CPI inflation is expected to fall significantly further in the near term, reflecting lower annual energy inflation, despite the renewed upward pressure from oil prices, and further declines in food and core goods price inflation. Services price inflation, however, is projected to remain elevated in the near term, with some potential month-to-month volatility. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Developments in key indicators of inflation persistence have been mixed, with the recent acceleration in the AWE not apparent in other measures of wages and with some downside news on services inflation. There are increasing signs of some impact of tighter monetary policy on the labour market and on momentum in the real economy more generally. Given the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of this tightening cycle, the current monetary policy stance is restrictive. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. The MPC will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price inflation. Monetary policy will need to be sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with the Committee’s remit. Further tightening in monetary policy would be required if there were evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures. The MPC committed in the minutes of its August 2022 meeting to review the reduction in the Asset Purchase Facility annually and, as part of that, to set an amount for the reduction in the stock of purchased UK government bonds over the subsequent 12-month period. At this meeting, the Committee voted to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes, and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £100 billion over the period from October 2023 to September 2024, to a total of £658 billion. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 20 September 2023 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decisions, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have increased by 0.5% in 2023 Q2, broadly in line with the August Monetary Policy Report projection. Global GDP growth of 0.3% was expected for Q3, also in line with the August Report, but with some differences across regions. 3: Euro-area GDP had increased by 0.1% in 2023 Q2 but was expected to contract in Q3, weaker than expected in the August Report. Manufacturing and services output PMIs had both entered contractionary territory, with weakness in German manufacturing output particularly pronounced. 4: In the United States, GDP had increased by 0.5% in 2023 Q2, and growth was expected to increase further in Q3, stronger than projected in the August Report for both quarters. In contrast to developments in the euro area, the manufacturing output PMI had stopped contracting and the services output PMI had remained in expansionary territory. 5: The Committee discussed some possible factors behind the recent relative strength of US activity. Real incomes had increased more strongly in the United States, uplifted partly by significant fiscal policy actions during the pandemic and a smaller deterioration in the terms of trade, whereas government support in Europe had abated as energy prices had fallen back. US households had also appeared relatively more willing to spend any excess savings, possibly due to higher consumer confidence. 6: Growth appeared to have slowed in China, with the NBS manufacturing PMI having remained below the neutral 50 level since April. Consumption and industrial production growth were similarly weak, alongside softer investment and falling exports. There had been notable headwinds from the property sector, with property prices falling and a major developer narrowly avoiding technical default. Taken together, these indicators pointed to Chinese growth slowing further in 2023 Q3, weaker than had been expected in the August Report. 7: Energy prices had increased since the MPC’s previous meeting. The Dutch Title Transfer Facility spot price, a measure of European wholesale gas prices, had risen by 26%, owing in part to strike action at Australian liquefied natural gas facilities, although the gas futures curve had been broadly unchanged. Brent spot oil prices had risen by 17%, to $93 per barrel, following supply cuts by the OPEC+ group, as well as oil inventories falling globally. 8: Headline consumer price inflation in the United States and euro area had continued to follow a downward trend from the peak rates recorded in 2022, although the impact of volatile energy prices had affected recent data. Annual euro-area HICP inflation had decreased slightly to 5.2% in August. In the United States, headline CPI inflation had increased to 3.7% in August from 3.2% in July, largely accounted for by a reduced drag from annual energy price inflation. 9: Underlying inflationary pressures had remained elevated across advanced economies. US annual core CPI inflation had fallen to 4.3% in August from 4.7% in July. Annual core inflation in the euro area had fallen to 5.3% in August from 5.5% in July. Outturns in pay growth in these regions had continued to be strong. Labour markets had remained tight though had shown some signs of easing. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio had decreased in the United States and had been broadly flat in the euro area. Monetary and financial conditions 10: Market pricing suggested that policy rates in major advanced economies were expected to be nearing their peaks. At its meeting ending on 14 September, the ECB Governing Council had raised its key policy rates by 25 basis points, while market expectations were for the Federal Open Market Committee to leave the federal funds rate unchanged at its forthcoming meeting ending on 20 September. In the United Kingdom, Bank Rate expectations implied by market pricing had fallen in the immediate run-up to the MPC’s meeting, following the August CPI release. That had left market expectations for the September Bank Rate decision finely balanced between a 25 basis point increase and no change. 11: There had also been a reduction in market expectations for the path of Bank Rate beyond the September MPC decision. Market pricing in the immediate run-up to the MPC’s meeting suggested a peak in Bank Rate of around 5.5%, held for around three quarters. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, the one-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate, one year forward had decreased by around 70 basis points. The market implied path for Bank Rate now averaged a little under 5% over the next three years. 12: Ten-year government bond yields in the United Kingdom were down a little relative to the MPC’s August meeting, in contrast to global peers, for whom rates at this horizon had risen somewhat. The Committee noted that the level of UK and US 10-year government bond yields had converged over the recent period. 13: There had continued to be evidence that interest rates in financial markets had been more sensitive to economic data outturns, particularly in the United Kingdom, than had been usual over the past decade. Nevertheless, these data outturns could be volatile from month to month. Overall, the sensitivity of UK interest rates to data releases relating to the nominal environment had remained greater than to releases relating to real activity, although there had been some reductions in market rates in response to both the August flash PMI and July GDP data releases. 14: As the MPC had previously communicated, it would vote at this meeting on the reduction in the stock of gilts held in the Bank’s Asset Purchase Facility for monetary policy purposes over the 12-month period from October 2023 to September 2024. According to the Market Participants Survey (MaPS), the median market expectation for the MPC’s pace of gilt stock reduction over the year ahead was £100 billion. 15: Medium-term inflation compensation measures in the United Kingdom were little changed relative to the MPC’s previous meeting. Although interpreting the level of these measures continued to be challenging, they had remained lower than their peak in March 2022, but above their average levels of the previous decade. The median MaPS respondent’s expectation for CPI inflation three years ahead was 2.0% in the latest survey, down slightly relative to the previous survey. The distribution of survey responses had, however, remained skewed to the upside. 16: Aggregate growth in sterling net lending by banks had continued to slow. Within that, new mortgage lending had continued to decline. While quoted mortgage rates had fallen somewhat since the MPC’s August meeting, largely reflecting pass-through of reductions in risk-free reference rates, they had remained substantially higher than at the start of the Bank Rate tightening cycle. Over that period, corporate credit conditions had also tightened and, consistent with that, and with subdued demand for credit, corporate lending growth had been weak. 17: The annual growth rate in aggregate sterling broad money had slowed further to 0% in July. The pass-through of increases in Bank Rate to instant-access savings accounts, which had previously been much slower than pass-through to time deposit accounts, had increased since the Committee’s previous meeting. The overall increase in such sight deposit rates had, however, remained substantially smaller than the increase in Bank Rate since the end of 2021. Demand and output 18: According to the ONS’s first quarterly estimate, real GDP had increased by 0.2% in 2023 Q2, marginally stronger than had been expected in the August Monetary Policy Report. Household consumption had risen by 0.6% and business investment by 3.4%, stronger than expected in the August Report. Housing investment had continued to fall, down by 2.3% on the quarter and by 7.7% on a year earlier. 19: Monthly GDP was estimated to have fallen by 0.5% in July, following a rise of 0.5% in June. The July outturn was weaker than had been expected in the August Report, particularly within the services sector. Measured government health services output had fallen sharply in part reflecting the impact of strikes, and poor weather had also appeared to have dampened activity in some sectors. Weakness in private services activity had otherwise been concentrated in transport and other business services sectors. 20: The S&P Global/CIPS UK composite output PMI had fallen in August, to 48.6, which was consistent with a fall in GDP based on past historical relationships. The future output PMI series had risen slightly, however, and remained close to its long-run average. Other business survey indicators of activity, including the Lloyds Business Barometer, had also remained consistent with positive GDP growth. The latest intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that activity had remained subdued and that there were growing concerns about the economic outlook, most notably from contacts in consumer-facing businesses but also from some in the business services sector. 21: Combining the signals from official data and business surveys, Bank staff now expected GDP to rise by only 0.1% in 2023 Q3, compared with the 0.4% increase incorporated in the August Report. Although some of this downside news could prove erratic, underlying growth was also likely to be weaker than the ¼% per quarter built into the August projection for the second half of 2023. 22: The Committee discussed the factors behind a slowing in GDP growth, including the impact of the significant tightening in monetary policy since the end of 2021. The clearest signs of weakness continued to be in the housing sector, with housing investment and most measures of house prices falling somewhat, alongside a low level of property transactions. Recent consumer spending indicators had shown fewer signs of softening, with consumer confidence recovering in August and real labour incomes now rising. Corporate spending indicators had generally weakened over recent months, however, with an increasing number of firms responding to the ONS Business Insights and Conditions Survey noting concerns about interest rates. The manufacturing export orders PMI had also fallen quite sharply recently, in part reflecting global developments. 23: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, the ONS had published some estimates of the impact of Blue Book 2023. GDP had been revised nearly 2% higher by 2021 Q4, although almost all of this news had been accounted for by stronger public sector output, largely reversing the revisions in Blue Book 2022. The Committee would consider the implications of revisions for supply as well as demand in its November forecast round discussions, by which time the Blue Book dataset beyond 2021 would also be available. Supply, costs and prices 24: There had been further signs of a loosening in the labour market, although it remained tight by historical standards. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported an easing in recruitment difficulties, but also persistent skills shortages in some sectors. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio had continued to decline, reflecting both a steady fall in the number of vacancies and rising unemployment. The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had risen to 4.3% in the three months to July, higher than expected in the August Monetary Policy Report forecast. The latest quarterly data had shown an increase in flows from inactivity into unemployment, indicative of some of the increase in unemployment having been associated with individuals that were previously inactive beginning to look for work, as well as a gradual increase in flows from employment into unemployment. 25: Indicators of employment had generally softened against a backdrop of subdued activity. LFS employment had fallen by 0.6% in the three months to July, but that had been preceded by a 0.8% increase in the previous non-overlapping three months. This series often fluctuated from one period to another and sample sizes and response rates to the LFS had been declining. The Bank’s Agents had reported that companies were expecting to keep staff numbers broadly stable, with few active plans to make redundancies. The KPMG/REC Report on Jobs was, however, pointing to a fall in companies hiring new staff. The S&P Global/CIPS composite employment PMI had also fallen in August, albeit only to around its historical average. 26: The Committee discussed what to infer from the latest developments in indicators of pay. Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth had been 8.1% in the three months to July, 0.8 percentage points above the August Report projection, with the news largely due to upward revisions to previous months’ data. Three-month-on-three-month growth for the same AWE measure had increased in recent months, with that strength seen across a number of different sectors. 27: The latest path of the AWE was, however, difficult to reconcile with other pay indicators, including measures using HMRC payrolls, the LFS and the Decision Maker Panel (DMP), which had tended to be more stable at rates that were elevated but not quite as high as the AWE series. The Bank’s Agents were continuing to report that average annual pay settlements were in the region of 6 to 6½%, with contacts expecting settlements to begin to drift down and for there to be fewer additional payments provided to compensate for a higher cost of living. Only the measures within the KPMG/REC Report were signalling a clear decrease in pay growth but, puzzlingly, their relationship with the AWE data had been less strong over the recent past. 28: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 6.8% in July, before edging down to 6.7% in August, 0.4 percentage points below the August Report forecast. The latest CPI release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. 29: While declines in CPI inflation had been largely driven by lower energy prices up to July, the fall in August had been driven by other components. A combination of past falls in petrol pump prices dropping out of the annual comparison and increases on the month had resulted in a higher rate of energy price inflation in August. In contrast, core CPI inflation, excluding energy, food, beverages and tobacco, had fallen to 6.2%, having been relatively stable at just under 7% in preceding months. 30: Lower core goods price inflation had accounted for just under two-thirds of the downside surprise in CPI inflation since the August Report. Some of the latest news had been confined to the more idiosyncratic used cars component. Downside news elsewhere in core goods, however, suggested that the recent easing in input cost pressures, evident in a flattening in non-petroleum producer prices, was feeding through to consumer goods prices more quickly than had been anticipated previously. There had been relatively modest and offsetting news in food and energy prices up to August. If sustained, recent significant increases in oil prices would, however, mean that the energy contribution to CPI inflation would be higher than assumed in the August Report forecast over coming months. 31: The remainder of the downside surprise in CPI inflation since August had been in services prices. Services CPI inflation had unexpectedly risen back to a 31-year high of 7.4% in July before falling more sharply than had been expected to 6.8% in August. Some of the increase in July and the subsequent unwind, along with the corresponding news, was linked to services such as airfares and accommodation that tended to be volatile over the summer holiday period. Excluding travel-related components such as these, services inflation had been more stable at continued high rates. Nevertheless, there had also been some downside news across this wider part of the consumer basket for services. 32: An underlying measure of services inflation produced by Bank staff, which was determined by the co-movement of price changes across services components, had begun to decline. The S&P Global/CIPS UK services input and output price PMIs had continued to fall towards their past averages, while Agents’ contacts were reporting that, although pay pressures had remained intense for consumer-facing services companies, other cost pressures were easing. 33: Abstracting from these underlying trends, the path of services inflation was likely to be volatile in coming months, in part reflecting potential noise in the prices of travel-related services. A temporary sharp upward spike was also anticipated in January 2024, as large and unusual falls in a number of services prices at the beginning of 2023 were not expected to be repeated, resulting in a positive base effect early next year. 34: Inflation expectations for the year ahead had remained at elevated levels. Businesses responding to the DMP were expecting their own prices to increase by around 5% over the next twelve months. Measures of household inflation expectations were broadly unchanged in both the Bank/Ipsos and Citi/YouGov surveys, within which the medium-term measures were closer to their historical averages. The immediate policy decisions 35: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 36: In the MPC’s August most likely, or modal, Monetary Policy Report projections, conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that had averaged just under 5½% over the three-year forecast period, CPI inflation had been expected to return to the 2% target by 2025 Q2. It had then been projected to fall below the target in the medium term, as an increasing degree of economic slack had been expected to reduce domestic inflationary pressures, alongside declining external cost pressures. The Committee had continued to judge that the risks around the modal inflation forecast were skewed to the upside, albeit by less than in May, reflecting the possibility that the second-round effects of external cost shocks on inflation in wages and domestic prices took longer to unwind than they did to emerge. The mean projection for CPI inflation, which incorporated these risks, had been 2.0% and 1.9% at the two and three-year horizons respectively. 37: The Committee discussed the news in recent UK economic data outturns. Past increases in Bank Rate were expected to weigh increasingly on the economy, with the impact of tighter monetary policy likely to be apparent earlier for indicators of demand and labour market tightness than for indicators of domestically generated inflation, such as wage growth and services CPI inflation, which were at a later stage in the monetary transmission mechanism. 38: While some of the weakening in recent activity data could prove erratic, Bank staff now expected GDP to rise only slightly in 2023 Q3. Underlying growth in the second half of 2023 was also likely to be weaker than had been expected. Ahead of its final meeting, the Committee was made aware of the flash S&P Global/CIPS UK composite PMI for September that would be released publically on Friday 22 September. 39: There had been some further signs of a loosening in the labour market, although it had remained tight by historical standards. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio had continued to decline, reflecting both a steady fall in the number of vacancies and a greater than expected rise in unemployment. 40: Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth had increased to 8.1% in the three months to July, 0.8 percentage points above the August Report projection. Most other indicators of pay had tended to be more stable at rates of growth that were elevated but not quite as high as the AWE series. 41: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 6.7% in August, 0.4 percentage points below expectations at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting. Services CPI inflation had declined to 6.8% in August, 0.3 percentage points lower than had been expected in the August Report. Some of those movements were linked to services such as airfares and accommodation that tended to be volatile over the summer holiday period. Excluding these travel-related components, services inflation had been more stable at continued high rates, albeit slightly weaker than had been expected. 42: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy would ensure that CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. Bank Rate decision 43: The Committee turned to its immediate decision on Bank Rate. Developments in key indicators of inflation persistence had been mixed, with the recent acceleration in the AWE not apparent in other measures of wages and with some downside news on services inflation. There were increasing signs of some impact of tighter monetary policy on the labour market and on momentum in the real economy more generally. Given the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of this tightening cycle, the current monetary policy stance was restrictive. This meant that the decision on whether to increase or to maintain Bank Rate at this meeting had become more finely balanced between the risks of not tightening policy enough when underlying inflationary pressures could still prove persistent, and not placing sufficient weight on the impact of the previous tightening that was still to come through on activity and inflation. 44: Five members judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 5.25% was warranted at this meeting. There were signs that the labour market was loosening. The recent acceleration in the AWE was noteworthy but was not apparent in other measures of wages. Although it was important not to put too much weight on a single data point, headline and services CPI inflation had fallen back and were lower than had been expected. Regarding activity, contacts of the Bank’s Agents had become more downbeat, and the output PMI in August was now consistent with falling GDP. For most members within this group, the latest developments meant that the judgement to keep Bank Rate unchanged at this meeting rather than increase it was finely balanced. Conditions were likely to warrant a restrictive policy stance being maintained until material progress had been made in returning inflation to the 2% target sustainably. For one member, however, the risks of overtightening policy had continued to build, increasing the likelihood of output losses and volatility that would require sharper reversals of policy. Lags in the effects of monetary policy meant that sizeable impacts from past rate increases were still to come through. 45: Four members judged that a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 5.5%, was warranted at this meeting. Although there were now some signs of weakening economic activity, consumer sentiment appeared to be holding up, real household incomes had started to rise, and forward-looking indicators of output had remained positive. The labour market was still relatively tight, consistent with a possible rise in the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment, and the pace of loosening had been slow. Measures of wage growth and services inflation had remained at rates above those consistent with meeting the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. While services CPI inflation had fallen by more than had been expected in the latest data release, this appeared to have been driven mainly by volatile components and had followed recent upside surprises. These members judged that overall there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures. Although the monetary stance was weighing increasingly on economic activity, a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate at this meeting was necessary to address the risks of more deeply embedded inflation persistence and bring inflation back to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. 46: The MPC would continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price inflation. Monetary policy would need to be sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with the Committee’s remit. Further tightening in monetary policy would be required if there were evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures. Decision on the annual pace of reduction in the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes 47: As set out in the minutes of its August 2022 meeting, the MPC had committed to review the reduction in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) annually and, as part of that, to set an amount for the reduction in the stock of purchased UK government bonds (gilts) over the subsequent 12-month period. Box A of the August 2023 Monetary Policy Report had set out an assessment of the process of quantitative tightening over the previous year. 48: The Committee judged that reducing the size of the APF had the important benefit of reducing the risk of a ratchet upwards in the size of the central bank balance sheet over time if successive policy cycles encountered the effective lower bound on interest rates. That in turn should increase the headroom and flexibility for the central bank to be able to use its balance sheet in the future should that be needed. 49: The appropriate pace of gilt stock reduction would continue to be guided by a set of key principles, which the MPC had first outlined in the August 2021 Monetary Policy Report. First, the Committee intended to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Second, sales would be conducted so as not to disrupt the functioning of financial markets. Third, to help achieve that, sales would be conducted in a gradual and predictable manner over a period of time. 50: As set out in the Box in the August 2023 Report, the Committee judged that quantitative tightening was going smoothly. There was no evidence of a negative impact of gilt sales on market functioning across a range of financial market measures. APF reduction was likely to have had some tightening effect on yields, which, while difficult to measure precisely, was judged to have been modest. That was in line with the MPC’s prior expectations, but the Committee would continue to learn from monitoring developments as the process progressed. 51: The tightening impact of the reduction in the APF on activity and inflation also appeared to have been, and was expected to be, modest. While it was hard to measure precisely the marginal effect of quantitative tightening, the MPC’s economic forecasts were conditioned on asset prices that incorporated announced and expected APF reduction alongside other factors. The MPC would therefore take this effect into account when setting the desired monetary policy stance using Bank Rate. Any tightening effect from the reduction in the APF would lead to a slightly lower path for Bank Rate, all else equal. Given that the impact of APF reduction was judged to have been modest, this was unlikely to have made a material difference to the appropriate path for Bank Rate over the past year. 52: Drawing on the experience of the first year of quantitative tightening, the Committee considered a number of factors which supported a modest increase in the pace of gilt stock reduction from £80 billion over the previous year to £100 billion over the 12 months ahead. First, an assessment of market conditions, and of market capacity to absorb the pace of gilt sales implied by a £100 billion gilt stock reduction, suggested that this pace was unlikely to disrupt the functioning of financial markets. Second, the Committee noted that a £100 billion gilt stock reduction over the year ahead would leave the pace of gilt sales broadly unchanged relative to the previous year, given some increase in APF gilt maturities. As set out in the August 2023 Report, the focus of the MPC was on total gilt stock reduction, comprising both maturing gilts and sales, such that variation in the profile of redemptions might also lead to variation in the pace of sales over time. Notwithstanding that, the Committee placed some weight on continuity in the pace of sales. Third, the Committee noted that over the previous year the £80 billion reduction in APF gilt holdings had been accompanied by the near-complete unwind of the £20 billion corporate bond portfolio, such that the overall reduction in the size of the APF over the past year had also been around £100 billion. Taken together, these factors supported a small increase in the pace of reduction in the stock of gilts relative to the previous year. 53: In the immediate run-up to this meeting, Bank staff had briefed the MPC on the current state of economic and market conditions. Current conditions were judged appropriate for the Committee to proceed with its preferred pace of gilt stock reduction. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) had also been briefed. 54: All members of the MPC agreed at this meeting that the Bank of England should reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes, and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £100 billion over the 12-month period from October 2023 to September 2024, comprising both maturing gilts and sales. 55: The MPC also reaffirmed that there would be a high bar for amending the planned reduction in the stock of purchased gilts outside a scheduled annual review. That was in order to remain consistent with the principles that Bank Rate should be the active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and that APF reduction should be predictable. In judging whether that bar was met, the FPC would also have a role through its assessment of financial stability. 56: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 5.25%; The Bank of England should reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes, and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £100 billion over the next twelve months, to a total of £658 billion. 57: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Swati Dhingra, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the first proposition. Four members (Jon Cunliffe, Megan Greene, Jonathan Haskel and Catherine L Mann) voted against the proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. 58: The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the second proposition. Operational considerations 59: On 20 September 2023, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £759 billion, comprising £759 billion of UK government bond purchases and £0.6 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases. 60: At its September 2022 meeting, the MPC had voted to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases by £80 billion over the 12-month period from October 2022 to September 2023. The Bank of England had set out in a Market Notice on 1 September how the 2023 Q3 gilt sales programme would be adjusted in order to meet the MPC's target. 61: At this meeting, the MPC had voted to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes by £100 billion over the 12-month period from October 2023 to September 2024. The details of the first quarter of the associated gilt sales programme, covering 2023 Q4, were set out in a Market Notice accompanying these minutes. The Bank would continue to set auction sizes each quarter, to meet the MPC’s annual target as closely as practicable. 62: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Ben Broadbent Jon Cunliffe Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden James Bowler was present as the Treasury representative. Sarah Breeden was present as an observer. 63: On behalf of the Committee, the Chair expressed his appreciation to Jon Cunliffe for his contributions to the work of the MPC since becoming a member in 2013 and for his role in establishing the monetary policy framework. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 1 November will be published on 2 November 2023.

At its meeting ending on 1 November 2023, the MPC voted by a majority of 6–3 to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Three members preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. The Committee’s updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying November Monetary Policy Report. These are conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that remains around 5¼% until 2024 Q3 and then declines gradually to 4¼% by the end of 2026, a lower profile than underpinned the August projections. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, long-term government bond yields have increased across advanced economies. GDP growth has been stronger than expected in the United States. Underlying inflationary pressures in advanced economies remain elevated. Following events in the Middle East, the oil futures curve has risen somewhat while gas futures prices are little changed. UK GDP is expected to have been flat in 2023 Q3, weaker than projected in the August Report. Some business surveys are pointing to a slight contraction of output in Q4 but others are less pessimistic. GDP is expected to grow by 0.1% in Q4, also weaker than projected previously. The MPC continues to consider a wide range of data to inform its view on developments in labour market activity, rather than focusing on a single indicator. The increasing uncertainties surrounding the Labour Force Survey underline the importance of this approach. Against a backdrop of subdued economic activity, employment growth is likely to have softened over the second half of 2023, and to a greater extent than projected in the August Report. Falling vacancies and surveys indicating an easing of recruitment difficulties also point to a loosening in the labour market. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents have similarly reported an easing in hiring constraints, although persistent skills shortages remain in some sectors. Pay growth has remained high across a range of indicators, although the recent rise in the annual rate of growth of private sector regular average weekly earnings has not been apparent in other series. There remains uncertainty about the near-term path of pay, but wage growth is nonetheless projected to decline in coming quarters from these elevated levels. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 6.7% both in September and 2023 Q3, below expectations in the August Report. This downside news largely reflects lower-than-expected core goods price inflation. At close to 7%, services inflation has been only slightly weaker than expected in August. CPI inflation remains well above the 2% target, but is expected to continue to fall sharply, to 4¾% in 2023 Q4, 4½% in 2024 Q1 and 3¾% in 2024 Q2. This decline is expected to be accounted for by lower energy, core goods and food price inflation and, beyond January, by some fall in services inflation. In the MPC’s latest most likely, or modal, projection conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate, CPI inflation returns to the 2% target by the end of 2025. It then falls below the target thereafter, as an increasing degree of economic slack reduces domestic inflationary pressures. The Committee continues to judge that the risks to its modal inflation projection are skewed to the upside. Second-round effects in domestic prices and wages are expected to take longer to unwind than they did to emerge. There are also upside risks to inflation from energy prices given events in the Middle East. Taking account of this skew, the mean projection for CPI inflation is 2.2% and 1.9% at the two and three-year horizons respectively. Conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 5.25%, which is a higher profile than the market curve beyond the second half of 2024, mean CPI inflation returns to target in two years’ time and falls to 1.6% at the three-year horizon. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Since the MPC’s previous decision, there has been little news in key indicators of UK inflation persistence. There have continued to be signs of some impact of tighter monetary policy on the labour market and on momentum in the real economy more generally. Given the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of this tightening cycle, the current monetary policy stance is restrictive. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. The MPC will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. Monetary policy will need to be sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with the Committee’s remit. The MPC’s latest projections indicate that monetary policy is likely to need to be restrictive for an extended period of time. Further tightening in monetary policy would be required if there were evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 1 November 2023 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying November 2023 Monetary Policy Report . 2: The Committee discussed the global economic outlook. Consumer price inflation had generally been easing in advanced economies, but remained elevated. There were upside risks to inflation from energy prices given events in the Middle East. Global growth had remained subdued over the course of 2023 and, in aggregate, had evolved largely as had been expected in the August Monetary Policy Report. Within that, in 2023 Q3, GDP growth in the United States and China had been stronger than expected while euro-area growth had been weaker. Bank staff judged that output was currently above potential in the United States and could remain so for some time, although the extent to which recent strength in activity had also reflected stronger supply was uncertain. In contrast, a sustained period of excess supply was expected in the euro area. In part, that reflected the greater exposure of Europe to the global energy price shock, which had contributed to a more significant trade-off between the outlooks for inflation and growth. 3: Market expectations for the paths of policy rates suggested that interest rates were at or near their peaks in the United Kingdom, the United States and the euro area. Monetary policymakers in each jurisdiction had described the stance of monetary policy as restrictive. Market participants had reported an increasing conviction that UK policy rates would remain ‘higher-for-longer’ and the median respondent to the Bank's latest Market Participants Survey expected Bank Rate to remain at 5.25% until the second half of 2024, before declining gradually. The sensitivity of interest rates over the year ahead to economic data outturns appeared to have diminished, with more variation in expected rates at the two and three-year horizons. 4: The Committee discussed movements in longer-term advanced economy government bond yields, which had risen materially since the MPC’s September meeting, with the largest moves seen in the United States. In part, that was likely to reflect market expectations that global policy rates would remain higher for longer during the current cycle. It was also possible that market perceptions of the equilibrium real interest rate had risen in recent years. Models used by Bank staff suggested that a rise in term premia, the additional compensation that investors required to hold longer-term bonds, had contributed to the most recent rise in longer-term global yields. That might have reflected increased uncertainty around the economic outlook and interest rates, as well as an evolving assessment of the balance of supply and demand in government bond markets. It remained the case, however, that changes in term premia had accounted for only a small proportion of the overall rise in longer-term advanced economy government bond yields over the past two years, relative to the contribution from the rise in expected policy rates. 5: The Committee discussed the recent weakening in UK GDP growth, in the context of the significant tightening of monetary policy since the end of 2021, continued weakness in potential supply growth and an unwinding of previous fiscal support. Quarterly GDP was expected to have been flat in 2023 Q3. Some business surveys of current output and orders were pointing to a fall in GDP in Q4, although other more forward-looking indicators were less pessimistic about growth prospects. 6: There had been increasing signs of some impact of tighter monetary policy on momentum in the real economy. This was perhaps clearest in weaker housing investment, for which the impact of tighter policy was likely to have come through most quickly. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents were reporting that higher financing costs, along with greater economic uncertainty, had also been inhibiting business investment, although companies with strong cash positions were continuing to invest. The tightening in monetary policy would take time to feed through to consumer spending fully and was taking effect against the backdrop of a broader recovery in real incomes. There had, however, been declines recently in retail sales volumes, consumer services output and consumer confidence. 7: The slowdown in GDP growth had been feeding into a softening of labour demand. A decline in response rates had resulted in the ONS temporarily ceasing to publish Labour Force Survey estimates of employment, unemployment and inactivity from the June data. Nevertheless, the collective steer from a broad range of indicators, which had tracked the underlying trends in official estimates of labour market activity in the past, pointed to employment being broadly flat in the second half of 2023. There was a narrower set of indicators available to monitor developments in the split of non-employment between unemployment and inactivity. The number of vacancies had continued to decline and indicators of recruitment difficulties had eased, consistent with the labour market loosening further. The labour market had nevertheless remained relatively tight. 8: The Committee discussed the degree of persistence in wages and domestic prices. The recent rise in the annual rate of growth of private sector regular average weekly earnings had not been apparent in other indicators of pay, but there was a common signal that wage growth had remained elevated at around 7%. At the same time, annual services CPI inflation had yet to recede meaningfully, with declines in headline inflation having instead been accounted for by lower energy, food and core goods price inflation. The recent persistence in CPI inflation had in part reflected second-round effects, including through companies’ price-setting behaviour. In its November Monetary Report projections, the MPC also judged that more of the recent unexpected strength in pay had been associated with a higher medium-term unemployment rate, owing to more persistent labour market frictions and a resistance to past losses in real income. To the extent that higher unemployment had reflected such supply-related factors, it would imply less easing in the labour market and hence weigh less on pay growth. The immediate policy decision 9: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 10: The Committee agreed that there had been little news in key indicators of UK inflation persistence since the MPC’s previous decision. Past increases in Bank Rate had weighed increasingly on the economy with the impact of tighter monetary policy likely to materialise earlier in demand and labour market tightness than in wage growth and services CPI inflation. 11: UK GDP was expected to have been unchanged in 2023 Q3, and to grow by 0.1% in Q4. In the MPC’s November Monetary Policy Report projections, GDP was expected to be broadly flat over the first half of the forecast period and growth was projected to remain well below historical averages in the medium term, a weaker profile than in the August Report. 12: Against this backdrop of subdued economic activity, and based on a range of indicators, employment growth was likely to have softened. Falling vacancies and surveys indicating an easing of recruitment difficulties also pointed to a loosening in the labour market. 13: Pay growth had remained high across a range of indicators, although the recent rise in the annual rate of growth of private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE) had not been apparent in other series. There remained uncertainty about the near-term path of pay. The MPC judged in its November Report projections that more of the recent unexpected strength in pay had been associated with a higher medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate, and therefore greater persistence in wage and price inflation. 14: Twelve-month CPI inflation remained well above the 2% target. Inflation had fallen to 6.7% both in September and 2023 Q3, below expectations in the August Report. The downside news had largely reflected lower-than-expected core goods price inflation. At close to 7%, services CPI inflation was only slightly weaker than had been expected in August. 15: In the MPC’s latest most likely, or modal, projections, conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate, CPI inflation was expected to return to the 2% target by the end of 2025. It was then projected to fall below the target thereafter, as an increasing degree of economic slack was expected to reduce domestic inflationary pressures. 16: The Committee continued to judge that the risks around the modal inflation projection were skewed to the upside. Second-round effects in domestic prices and wages were expected to take longer to unwind than they had done to emerge. There were also upside risks to inflation from energy prices given events in the Middle East. Taking account of this skew, the mean projection for CPI inflation was 2.2% and 1.9% at the two and three-year horizons respectively. 17: The MPC also considered its projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 5.25% over the forecast period, which was a higher profile than the market curve beyond the second half of 2024. Under this alternative assumption, mean CPI inflation was expected to return to the 2% target in two years’ time, three quarters earlier than when conditioned on the market-implied path for interest rates. 18: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy would ensure that CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. 19: Given the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of this tightening cycle, the current monetary policy stance was restrictive. The decision whether to increase or to maintain Bank Rate at this meeting was again finely balanced between the risks of not tightening policy enough when underlying inflationary pressures could prove more persistent, and the risks of tightening policy too much given the impact of policy that was still to come through. 20: Six members judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 5.25% was warranted at this meeting. There had been little news in UK economic data since the previous meeting. GDP growth had weakened and the labour market had continued to loosen. CPI inflation was expected to decline significantly in coming quarters, and the acceleration in AWE, while noteworthy, was not reflected in a broader range of wage growth measures. For most members within this group, the MPC’s latest projections indicated that a restrictive monetary policy stance was likely to be warranted for an extended period of time to bring inflation sustainably back to the 2% target. A further rise in Bank Rate remained a possibility. For one member, the risks of overtightening policy had continued to build. Lags in the effects of monetary policy meant that sizeable impacts from past rate increases were still to come through. 21: Three members preferred a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 5.5%, at this meeting. Although there was some weakening in economic activity, real household incomes had continued to rise, and forward-looking indicators of output had remained positive. The labour market was still relatively tight, consistent with a rise in the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment and strong labour demand, and the pace of loosening had been slow. Measures of wage growth and services inflation had remained elevated. These members continued to judge that there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures. An increase in Bank Rate at this meeting was necessary to address the risks of more deeply embedded inflation persistence and bring inflation back to target sustainably in the medium term. 22: The MPC would continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. Monetary policy would need to be sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with the Committee’s remit. The MPC’s latest projections indicated that monetary policy was likely to need to be restrictive for an extended period of time. Further tightening in monetary policy would be required if there were evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures. 23: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 5.25%. 24: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Swati Dhingra, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members (Megan Greene, Jonathan Haskel and Catherine L Mann) voted against the proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. Operational considerations 25: On 25 September, the Bank of England had completed the final gilt sales auction of the October 2022 to September 2023 annual programme to meet the MPC’s decision to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes by £80 billion over that period. 26: At its September 2023 meeting, the MPC had voted to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes by £100 billion over the 12-month period from October 2023 to September 2024. The first auction of that annual programme had taken place on 2 October 2023. 27: On 1 November, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £751 billion, comprising £750 billion of UK government bond purchases and £0.6 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases. 28: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Ben Broadbent Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Sarah Breeden was present as an observer before becoming a member on 1 November. Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. Ben Bernanke was present as an observer. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 13 December will be published on 14 December 2023.

At its meeting ending on 13 December 2023, the MPC voted by a majority of 6–3 to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Three members preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. In the MPC’s November Monetary Policy Report projections, conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that remained around 5¼% until 2024 Q3 and then declined gradually to 4¼% by the end of 2026, GDP was expected to be broadly flat in the first half of the forecast period, in part reflecting relatively weak potential supply, and an increasing degree of economic slack was expected to emerge from the start of next year. In the most likely, or modal, projection, CPI inflation returned to the 2% target by the end of 2025 and fell below the target thereafter. The Committee continued to judge that the risks to its modal inflation projection were skewed to the upside, such that the mean projection for CPI inflation was 2.2% and 1.9% at the two and three-year horizons. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, advanced-economy government bond yields have fallen materially, including at shorter horizons, and risky asset prices have risen. Global GDP growth has been a little stronger than projected in the November Report. Consumer price inflation in the euro area and the United States has declined more quickly than expected. There remain upside risks to inflation given events in the Middle East, although oil and wholesale gas futures prices have fallen. UK GDP was flat in 2023 Q3, in line with the November Report projection, and fell by 0.3% in October. Based on the latest official and survey data, Bank staff expect GDP growth to be broadly flat in Q4 and over coming quarters. The Committee continues to consider a wide range of data on developments in labour market activity. Employment growth is likely to have softened, and there has been further evidence of some loosening in the labour market. Relative to the assumptions in the November Report, the fiscal measures in the Autumn Statement are provisionally estimated to increase the level of GDP by around ¼% over coming years. As these measures will probably also boost potential supply to some extent, the implications for the Committee’s output gap projection, and hence inflationary pressures in the economy, are likely to be smaller. Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth declined to 7.3% in the three months to October, 0.5 percentage points below the November Report projection. That has brought AWE somewhat more into line with other indicators of pay growth, which have fallen below 7%. There remain upside risks to the outlook for wage growth, including from the possible effects of the recently announced increase in the National Living Wage. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell sharply from 6.7% in September to 4.6% in October. Services price inflation declined to 6.6%, although much of the downside news relative to the November Report reflected movements in components that may not provide a good signal of underlying trends in services prices and of persistence in headline inflation. CPI inflation is expected to remain near to its current rate around the turn of the year. In particular, services price inflation is projected to increase temporarily in January, related to base effects from unusually weak price movements at the start of this year, before starting to fall back gradually thereafter. The near-term path for CPI inflation is somewhat lower than projected in the November Report, in part reflecting recent declines in energy prices. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Since the MPC’s previous decision, CPI inflation has fallen back broadly as expected, while there has been some downside news in private sector regular AWE growth. However, key indicators of UK inflation persistence remain elevated. As anticipated, tighter monetary policy is leading to a looser labour market and is weighing on activity in the real economy more generally. Given the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of this tightening cycle, the current monetary policy stance is restrictive. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. The MPC will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. Monetary policy will need to be sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with the Committee’s remit. As illustrated by the November Monetary Policy Report projections, the Committee continues to judge that monetary policy is likely to need to be restrictive for an extended period of time. Further tightening in monetary policy would be required if there were evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 13 December 2023 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.5% in 2023 Q3, a touch stronger than projected in the November Monetary Policy Report. Growth among advanced economies had diverged, with significantly weaker growth in the euro area than in the United States. In Q4, global GDP growth was expected to slow to 0.4%. 3: Euro-area GDP had contracted by 0.1% in the third quarter, just above the November Report projection, and was expected to be flat in 2023 Q4. Near-term indicators such as services and manufacturing output PMIs had stabilised over recent months, albeit at levels indicating a contraction in activity. Industrial production had remained weak, particularly in energy-intensive sectors. 4: By contrast, US GDP had grown by 1.3% in 2023 Q3, stronger than had been expected in the November Report, but was projected to slow markedly in the fourth quarter. Recent data releases had shown signs of softening consumption growth, and both services and manufacturing ISM PMIs had weakened relative to the third quarter. 5: In China, GDP had grown by 1.3% in 2023 Q3. Going forward, growth was expected to slow given relatively weak momentum in recent indicators such as PMIs. Annual consumer price inflation in China had turned negative over recent months, in part accounted for by lower food prices. 6: Since the MPC’s November meeting and despite the continuing conflict in the Middle East, the Brent spot oil price had fallen by 17%, to around $75 per barrel, owing to a combination of slowing global demand, evidence of supply increases from non-OPEC countries, less binding OPEC supply cuts than had been anticipated by market participants, as well as healthy US inventory growth. European wholesale gas spot and near-term futures prices had fallen by nearly 30%, as storage levels were almost full going into winter and as forecasts of warmer weather had curbed demand expectations, while supply had been boosted by a re-opening of Israel’s production capacity. 7: The Committee discussed the relative extent of disinflation across advanced economies and the risks around the global inflation outlook. Consumer price inflation had declined more quickly in the euro area and the United States over recent months than had been expected in the November Report. According to the flash estimate, annual euro-area headline HICP inflation had fallen to 2.4% in November. Energy and food prices had contributed to the decline, and core goods and services price inflation had also declined such that core inflation had fallen to 3.6%. In the United States, headline CPI inflation had fallen to 3.1% in November, with energy price deflation contributing to the decline. Core CPI inflation had remained more stable in recent months, at 4.0%, as core services price inflation had eased more slowly. 8: Relative to both economies, core inflation had fallen back by less in the United Kingdom, to 5.7% in October, reflecting smaller declines so far in core goods price inflation and more elevated services price inflation. To the extent that they were broadly comparable, measures of wage inflation were also considerably higher in the United Kingdom than elsewhere, even though there were signs of easing in all three economies. 9: Looking forward, domestically generated inflationary pressures in most advanced economies remained elevated and could yet keep headline inflation above central bank targets for some time. There was also a risk that developments in the Middle East could lead to a renewed rise in energy, and potentially other traded goods, prices. Such a shock would push inflation higher once again, and could interact with inflation expectations and lead to second-round effects. Monetary and financial conditions 10: Since the Committee’s previous meeting, government bond yields had fallen materially across major advanced economies, including at shorter horizons. Corporate credit spreads had also declined and equity prices had picked up. 11: Market pricing suggested that policy interest rates in most major advanced economies were at their expected peaks and would remain there for several months. In contrast to developments during much of this year, recent economic news had had less impact on expected peak policy rates, which had remained relatively stable. Instead, recent news had tended to affect, and on net reduce, the length of time policy rates were expected to stay at the peak. 12: In the United Kingdom, all of the respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected Bank Rate to be left unchanged at this MPC meeting. The median MaPS respondent expected Bank Rate to remain at 5.25% until the second half of 2024, before declining gradually. Option-implied market pricing suggested that market participants had increased the probability they placed on Bank Rate remaining at its current level in three months’ time. The fall in longer-term UK government bond yields since the previous MPC meeting had been somewhat less pronounced than in the United States and in the euro area. Broadly consistent with this, the sterling effective exchange rate had ended the period around 2% higher. 13: Despite having fallen since the MPC’s previous meeting, ten-year government bond yields across major advanced economies remained materially higher than at the start of the current monetary policy tightening cycle, by around 325 basis points in the United Kingdom. There was some evidence that UK long rates had been more sensitive to changes in short rates during this tightening cycle than during the period before the global financial crisis, perhaps because of changes in market participants’ perceptions about the level of the neutral rate of interest and about inflation persistence. 14: Medium-term inflation compensation measures in the United Kingdom had fallen slightly relative to the MPC’s previous meeting. Although interpreting the level of these measures continued to be difficult, they had remained lower than their peak in March 2022, but above their average levels of the previous decade. The median MaPS respondent’s expectation for CPI inflation three years ahead was 2.0% in the latest survey, down slightly relative to the previous survey. 15: Aggregate sterling net lending by banks (M4Lex) had fallen in October, and the twelve-month growth rate had continued to be negative, albeit slightly less so than in September. Within that, annual growth in gross mortgage lending had slowed further. Quoted rates on fixed-rate mortgage products had fallen further since the MPC’s previous meeting, largely reflecting the pass-through of reductions in their corresponding risk-free reference rates. 16: The annual growth rate of aggregate sterling broad money (M4ex) had remained negative in October, at around -3%. Within that, annual growth in household deposits had continued to slow, such that the ratio of household deposits to gross disposable income, which had increased sharply during the Covid lockdown period in 2020, had now fallen to just above its pre-Covid level. Demand and output 17: The level of real GDP had been unchanged in 2023 Q3, in line with expectations at the time of the November Monetary Policy Report, but weaker than the positive growth that had been recorded during the first half of the year. Domestic demand growth had been weaker than expected in Q3, with household consumption estimated to have fallen by 0.4%, and business and housing investment down by 4.2% and 1.3% respectively. 18: Monthly GDP had fallen by 0.3% in October, weaker than had been expected though following a 0.2% increase in September. The declines in output had been broad based across the services, production and construction sectors. Abstracting from volatility in government health services output, market sector activity had fallen to its lowest level since December 2022. 19: Set against that softness, the S&P Global/CIPS UK composite output PMI had risen back above 50 in November, consistent with broadly unchanged GDP. Business survey indicators of future growth had also remained more positive. The latest intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that demand had weakened slightly further over recent weeks, however. Overall, Bank staff now expected GDP to be flat in 2023 Q4, compared with the 0.1% positive growth that had been projected in the November Report. 20: Signs of weakening in household consumption had become more evident since the MPC’s previous meeting. Real household labour incomes looked to have continued to rise during the second half of the year. Nevertheless, retail sales volumes had declined by 0.3% in October, following a 1.1% fall in September, which had taken spending to its lowest level since the 2021 Covid lockdown period. The Bank’s Agents had also reported flat or falling consumer goods volumes compared to a year ago. GfK consumer confidence had risen in November, although it had been broadly flat since the spring at an historically weak level. 21: Alongside continued falls in housing investment, indicators of housing market activity and prices had remained weak. The UK House Price Index had declined by 0.5% in September but that had reversed a similar-sized increase in August, and prices had been broadly unchanged over the previous year. More timely indicators of prices had picked up a little over recent months. A range of indicators of housing construction activity were consistent with a further decline in dwelling investment at the end of this year. 22: The Autumn Statement had taken place on 22 November, accompanied by an Economic and fiscal outlook from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The OBR had judged that the medium-term fiscal outlook had improved, with receipts being boosted by the interaction of higher nominal earnings and frozen tax thresholds. 23: Additional fiscal measures had been announced in the Statement, including a 2 pence cut in the main rate of employee National Insurance Contributions, a permanent 100% capital allowance for qualifying business investment, and a package of reforms to welfare and health services designed to increase labour market participation. Relative to what had been assumed in the November Report, Bank staff had provisionally estimated that these additional measures could increase the level of GDP by around ¼% over coming years. As the measures would probably also boost potential supply to some extent, the implications for the Committee’s output gap projection, and hence inflationary pressures in the economy, were likely to be smaller. A full assessment of this news would be conducted as part of the February Report forecast round. Supply, costs and prices 24: Reflecting in part the increased uncertainties around the ONS’s official labour market activity data, the Committee was continuing to consider a wide range of indicators that collectively pointed to some loosening in the labour market. The ONS was expected to release updated Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates in January to reflect more recent UK population figures, including higher net migration since 2021. 25: Quarterly employment growth had been slowing, as reflected by the HMRC PAYE Real Time Information measure, and broadly in line with the November Monetary Policy Report projection. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported softening labour demand relative to supply over the past year, consistent with surveys such as the REC/KPMG Report on Jobs that had also indicated a continued easing in recruitment difficulties. The ONS’s experimental estimate of the unemployment rate, based on the LFS data for June projected forward in line with the claimant count, had remained flat at 4.2% in the three months to October. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio had fallen to 0.66 in the three months to October, slightly above the levels seen just prior to the pandemic, accounted for mainly by a fall in vacancies. 26: Indicators of pay growth had declined, although they had remained elevated overall. Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth had been 7.3% in the three months to October, 0.8 percentage points lower than in the three months to July and 0.5 percentage points lower than the November Report projection. This decline had brought the AWE series somewhat more in line with, but still higher than, other indicators of pay that had dipped below 7% in October. Excluding government-related sectors, a Bank staff calculation based on HMRC PAYE Real Time Information suggested that median pay growth had fallen further in November, although these data were early estimates subject to revision. 27: The downward trend in wage growth was broadly consistent with more forward-looking indicators. Expectations for future wage growth from the Decision Maker Panel (DMP) Survey had fallen to 5% in October from around 6% at the start of the year. Early intelligence from the Bank’s Agents signalled a fall in average annual pay settlements in 2024. The Committee noted continued upside risks to wage growth forecasts, however. This included the direct and possible indirect effects of the recently announced increase in the National Living Wage, for example if existing pay relativities within businesses were re-established. 28: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen sharply from 6.7% in September to 4.6% in October, 0.2 percentage points below the November Report forecast. The latest CPI release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. 29: The decline in CPI inflation over recent months could largely be attributed to falls in energy, food, and core goods price inflation, as external cost pressures had continued to abate. Services price inflation had remained elevated, however. 30: The reduction in the Ofgem energy price cap in October had reduced materially the typical household energy bill compared to a year ago. Despite the announced rise in the price cap by around 5% in January, energy was expected to continue to contribute negatively to annual CPI inflation over the next six months, and to a greater extent than had been expected previously, reflecting the recent declines in oil prices as well as in wholesale gas futures prices if sustained. 31: Core goods price inflation was projected to fall further in coming quarters, reflecting base effects and decreasing cost pressures, including from easing global goods price inflation. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents anticipated further declines in food price inflation, with a number having revised their estimates lower compared to November. 32: Services price inflation had remained higher than overall CPI inflation at 6.6% in October, a fall of 0.3 percentage points from September and 0.3 percentage points lower than expected in the November Report. This downside news, however, had been accounted for by those components that were not typically reliable indicators of trends in inflationary persistence, such as non-private rents, accommodation and airfares. Excluding these components, services inflation had been more stable at continued high rates, in line with the preceding six months. 33: The S&P Global/CIPS UK services input and output price PMIs had remained below their peaks in early 2022, while Agents’ contacts had reported that non-labour cost-pressures were moderating. Although a general easing in services price inflation was therefore anticipated over 2024, a temporary spike was likely in January. Large and unusual falls in a number of services prices at the beginning of 2023 were not expected to be repeated at the start of next year, which would increase mechanically the annual percentage change in services price inflation in January. This positive base effect was expected to increase CPI inflation from just under 4½% at the end of this year to around 4¾% in January, before falling back closer to 4% in February. 34: Inflation expectations for the year ahead had remained at elevated levels, particularly for businesses. Short-term business expectations, as measured in the DMP Survey, had eased slightly, although three-year expectations had been marginally higher. Households’ short-term inflation expectations had continued to fall below the peaks seen in 2022. Longer-term household expectations had remained higher, but at close to their historical averages. The immediate policy decision 35: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 36: In the MPC’s November Monetary Policy Report projections, GDP had been expected to be broadly flat in the first half of the forecast period, in part reflecting relatively weak potential supply. An increasing degree of economic slack had been expected to emerge from the start of next year, although the pace at which that slack emerged would depend on the relative contributions of supply and demand news to developments in activity. The Committee was undertaking a full review of the overall supply capacity of the economy in its regular stocktake ahead of the February Report. 37: As anticipated, tighter monetary policy was leading to a looser labour market and was weighing on activity in the real economy more generally. Based on the latest official and survey data, Bank staff expected GDP growth to be broadly flat in 2023 Q4 and over coming quarters. The Committee would continue to monitor closely the impact on activity and inflation of the significant increase in Bank Rate. It would also consider the impact of recent financial market movements on its macroeconomic projections as part of the forecast round ahead of its next meeting. 38: In the most likely, or modal, November Report projection, conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that had remained around 5¼% until 2024 Q3 and then had declined gradually to 4¼% by the end of 2026, CPI inflation had been expected to return to the 2% target by the end of 2025 and to fall below the target thereafter. The Committee had continued to judge that the risks to its modal inflation projection were skewed to the upside, such that the mean projection for CPI inflation had been 2.2% and 1.9% at the two and three-year horizons. 39: Since the MPC’s previous decision, CPI inflation had fallen back broadly as expected, to 4.6% in October. Key indicators of UK inflation persistence remained elevated. Services price inflation had declined to 6.6%, although much of the downside news relative to the November Report had reflected movements in components that might not provide a good signal of underlying trends in services prices and of persistence in headline inflation. 40: There had been some downside news in private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings growth, but it was important not to over-interpret developments in any one measure, which had to be placed in the context of the evolution of broader pay dynamics. There remained upside risks to the outlook for wage growth, including from the possible effects of the recently announced increase in the National Living Wage. Relative to developments in the United States and the euro area, measures of wage inflation were considerably higher in the United Kingdom and services price inflation had fallen back by less so far. 41: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy would ensure that CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy was also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. 42: Given the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of this tightening cycle, the current monetary policy stance was restrictive. The decision whether to increase or to maintain Bank Rate at this meeting was again finely balanced between the risks of not tightening policy enough when underlying inflationary pressures could prove more persistent, and the risks of tightening policy too much given the impact of policy that was still to come through. 43: Six members judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 5.25% was warranted at this meeting. Although some of the news in key data had been to the downside since the MPC’s previous decision, economic developments had been relatively limited overall. For most members within this group, it was too early to conclude that services price inflation and pay growth were on a firmly downward path. Both of these metrics of inflation persistence remained higher than in other major advanced economies, possibly reflecting less favourable supply-side developments and stronger second-round effects in the United Kingdom. Second-round effects were likely to be slow to unwind and, with the labour market still tight, the extent to which wage and price-setting would take account of the downward path of CPI inflation was not clear. The risks to CPI inflation in the medium term remained skewed to the upside including from events in the Middle East. For one member, the risks of overtightening policy had continued to build. Lags in the effects of monetary policy meant that sizeable impacts from past rate increases were still to come through. 44: Three members preferred a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 5.5%, at this meeting. Although current indicators of economic activity had remained subdued, real household incomes had continued to edge up, and forward-looking indicators of output had remained positive. The labour market was still relatively tight, consistent with a rise in the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment, and the pace of loosening had been slow. Measures of wage growth had moderated slightly but had remained at rates above those consistent with the inflation target. Underlying services price inflation had remained elevated. These members continued to judge that there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures. Financial conditions had eased since the November Report. An increase in Bank Rate at this meeting was necessary to address the risks of more deeply embedded inflation persistence and to return inflation to target sustainably in the medium term. 45: The MPC would continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. Monetary policy would need to be sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with the Committee’s remit. As was illustrated by the November Monetary Policy Report projections, the Committee continued to judge that monetary policy was likely to need to be restrictive for an extended period of time. Further tightening in monetary policy would be required if there were evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures. 46: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 5.25%. 47: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Swati Dhingra, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members (Megan Greene, Jonathan Haskel and Catherine L Mann) voted against the proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. Operational considerations 48: At its September 2023 meeting, the MPC had voted to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes by £100 billion over the 12-month period from October 2023 to September 2024, comprising both maturing gilts and sales. The MPC had been briefed on progress on these gilt sales and on the operational arrangements for 2024 Q1, which would be published in a Market Notice at 4.30pm on 15 December. 49: On 13 December, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £744 billion, comprising just under £744 billion of UK government bond purchases and £0.4 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases. 50: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Ben Broadbent Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 31 January will be published on 1 February 2024.

At its meeting ending on 31 January 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 6–3 to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Two members preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. One member preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%. The Committee’s updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying February Monetary Policy Report. These are conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that declines from 5¼% to around 3¼% by the end of the forecast period, almost 1 percentage point lower on average than in the November Report. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, global GDP growth has remained subdued, although activity continues to be stronger in the United States. Inflationary pressures are abating across the euro area and United States. Wholesale energy prices have fallen significantly. Material risks remain from developments in the Middle East and from disruption to shipping through the Red Sea. Following recent weakness, GDP growth is expected to pick up gradually during the forecast period, in large part reflecting a waning drag on the rate of growth from past increases in Bank Rate. Business surveys are consistent with an improving outlook for activity in the near term. The labour market has continued to ease, but remains tight by historical standards. In the February Report projections, the continuing relative weakness of demand, despite subdued supply growth by historical standards, leads a margin of economic slack to emerge during the first half of the forecast period. Unemployment is expected to rise somewhat further. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 4.0% in December 2023, below expectations in the November Report. This downside news has been broad-based, reflecting lower fuel, core goods and services price inflation. Although still elevated, wage growth has eased across a number of measures and is projected to decline further in coming quarters. CPI inflation is projected to fall temporarily to the 2% target in 2024 Q2 before increasing again in Q3 and Q4. This profile of inflation over the second half of the year is accounted for by developments in the direct energy price contribution to 12-month inflation, which becomes less negative. In the MPC’s latest most likely, or modal, projection conditioned on the lower market-implied path for Bank Rate, CPI inflation is around 2¾% by the end of this year. It then remains above target over nearly all of the remainder of the forecast period. This reflects the persistence of domestic inflationary pressures, despite an increasing degree of slack in the economy. CPI inflation is projected to be 2.3% in two years’ time and 1.9% in three years. The Committee judges that the risks around its modal CPI inflation projection are skewed to the upside over the first half of the forecast period, stemming from geopolitical factors. It now judges that the risks from domestic price and wage pressures are more evenly balanced, meaning that, unlike in previous forecasts, there is no difference between the MPC’s modal and mean projections at the two and three-year horizons. Conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 5.25%, the path for CPI inflation is significantly lower than in the Committee’s modal projection conditioned on the declining path of market rates, falling below the 2% target from 2025 Q4 onwards. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Headline CPI inflation has fallen back relatively sharply. The restrictive stance of monetary policy is weighing on activity in the real economy and is leading to a looser labour market. In the Committee’s February forecast, the risks to inflation are more balanced. Although services price inflation and wage growth have fallen by somewhat more than expected, key indicators of inflation persistence remain elevated. As a result, monetary policy will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term in line with the MPC’s remit. The Committee has judged since last autumn that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipates. The MPC remains prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It will therefore continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. On that basis, the Committee will keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 31 January 2024 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying February 2024 Monetary Policy Report . 2: Consumer price inflation across major advanced economies had declined by more than had been expected in the November Report, with continued easing of both goods and services price inflation. The Committee compared features of the disinflation seen across the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom, and the risks around the inflation outlook. The Committee judged that the divergence seen across economies reflected differences in energy price dynamics and variation in the impact and timing of recent global shocks and their subsequent dissipation, alongside distinct profiles for spare capacity. Disinflation in core goods prices had been comparatively more pronounced so far in the United States because in the euro area and the United Kingdom the lag between falls in producer output price inflation and core consumer goods inflation had shown signs that it might have been longer than in previous cycles. 3: There had also been some differences, as well as commonalities, in the development of services price inflation and wage growth across these economies. Bank staff analysis suggested that the recent falls in services inflation across the three economies had been accounted for largely by declining non-labour input costs, including energy. Labour costs, by contrast, had remained elevated across countries, although there were some signs of easing emerging, particularly in the United States. To the extent that they were broadly comparable, measures of wage inflation had remained considerably higher in the United Kingdom than elsewhere. 4: In the United Kingdom, all of the respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected Bank Rate to be left unchanged at this MPC meeting. They also all expected the next move in the Bank Rate to be downward. The median expected profile for Bank Rate from the MaPS implied a cumulative 100 basis point reduction in Bank Rate this year starting from June 2024, broadly in line with market pricing. Market contacts had suggested that disinflationary news in recent economic data outturns both in other jurisdictions and in the United Kingdom had been a significant factor in the downward moves in UK short-term rates in recent months. Similar downward moves in short-term rates had also occurred in other advanced economies over this period. 5: UK GDP growth had weakened in 2023, with this weakness particularly pronounced in market sector output. This reflected the significant tightening of monetary policy implemented since the end of 2021 to contain the persistence of second-round effects on inflation as well as continued weakness in potential supply growth. Cumulative GDP growth over 2023 as a whole had been materially weaker than expected at the time of the November Report, with the path for household consumption notably below expectations. Timelier indicators suggested that activity would edge up in 2024 Q1. 6: The Committee had completed its annual supply stocktake, as set out in Section 3 of the February Report, and judged that potential supply growth remained weak by historical standards. The MPC also now judged that the degree of excess demand had been a little higher over the recent past than had been assumed in the November Report, implying weaker supply growth in the past. At the same time, it had revised up slightly its view of potential supply growth in the future, although this was still expected to be weaker than the rates seen pre-Covid. 7: The Committee discussed the degree of persistence in wage growth and domestic price inflation. There had been downside news in headline CPI inflation relative to the November Report, accounted for by a combination of fuel, core goods and services prices. In absolute terms, services price inflation remained significantly elevated. There had been a common signal from a range of indicators that wage growth had eased somewhat recently, although it had remained significantly elevated overall. This downward trend had been most pronounced in the annual rate of growth of private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE), although that had brought the AWE series more into line with other indicators. 8: The majority of this year’s wage setting processes would conclude in the next few months. A survey of firms conducted by the Bank’s Agents suggested that the average pay settlement in 2024 would be for a rise only slightly lower than in 2023, at 5.4%. It remained to be seen to what degree the falls in CPI inflation and short-term inflation expectations would influence this year’s wage setting, although this could also be influenced by a catch-up effect following the high rates of CPI inflation seen over the past couple of years. Evidence from the Agents suggested some possible upward pressures on wages from indirect effects of the increase in the National Living Wage. Intelligence from the Agents, however, also suggested that companies would not be able to pass on increased costs into prices as much as they had done in 2023. The immediate policy decision 9: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 10: In the MPC’s February Monetary Policy Report projections, UK GDP was expected to have been flat in 2023 Q4. Growth was expected to pick up gradually during the forecast period, in large part reflecting a waning drag from past increases in Bank Rate. In the medium term, the lower market-implied interest rate path, on which the forecast was conditioned, pushed up on GDP materially compared with the November projection. 11: The labour market had continued to ease, but had remained tight. In the February Report projections, the continuing relative weakness of demand, despite subdued supply growth by historical standards, led to a margin of economic slack emerging during the first half of the forecast period. Relative to November, the output gap projection had been pushed up by the boost to demand from the lower market path of interest rates. Equivalently, this implied that, if monetary policy were to follow the yield curve, then the stance of policy would be less restrictive than at the time of the November Report. 12: Twelve-month CPI inflation had remained above the 2% target. Inflation had fallen to 4.0% in December, below expectations in the November Report. The downside news had been broad-based, reflecting lower fuel, core goods and services price inflation. Although still elevated, wage growth had eased across a number of measures and was projected to decline further in coming quarters. 13: In the MPC’s latest most likely, or modal, projections, CPI inflation was expected to fall temporarily to the 2% target in 2024 Q2 before increasing again in Q3 and Q4. This profile of inflation over the second half of the year was accounted for by developments in the direct energy price contribution to 12-month inflation, which becomes less negative. Conditioned on a lower market-implied path for Bank Rate than had underpinned the November Report, CPI inflation was then projected to remain above the 2% target over nearly all of the remainder of the forecast period, owing to persistence in domestic inflationary pressures. 14: The Committee judged that the risks around the modal inflation projection were skewed to the upside over the first half of the forecast period, stemming from geopolitical factors. Risks from domestic price and wage pressures were now more evenly balanced, however. Taken together, this meant there was no difference between the MPC’s modal and mean projections at the two and three-year horizons. 15: The MPC judged that monetary policy would need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with the MPC’s remit. The Committee had judged since last autumn that monetary policy needed to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipated. 16: Six members judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 5.25% was warranted at this meeting. Headline CPI inflation had fallen back relatively sharply. The restrictive stance of monetary policy was weighing on activity and was leading to a looser labour market. In the Committee’s February forecast, the risks to inflation were more balanced. Although services price inflation and wage growth had fallen by somewhat more than had been expected, key indicators of inflation persistence remained elevated. There were questions, on which further evidence would be required, about how entrenched this persistence would be, and therefore about how long the current level of Bank Rate would need to be maintained. 17: Two members preferred a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 5.5%, at this meeting. Although headline inflation had fallen by more than had been expected, this was not necessarily informative about inflation persistence. Current indicators of economic activity had remained subdued, but real household incomes had continued to edge up, and forward-looking indicators of output had remained positive. The labour market was still relatively tight, consistent with a rise in the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment, and a range of indicators suggested that the pace of loosening had been slow. Measures of wage growth had moderated further but remained at rates above those consistent with the inflation target. Underlying services price inflation had slowed but remained elevated. These members continued to judge that there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures than included within the forecast. Financial conditions had eased since the MPC’s December meeting. An increase in Bank Rate at this meeting was necessary to address the risks of more deeply embedded inflation persistence and to return inflation to target sustainably in the medium term. 18: One member preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. For this member, the increments applied on the way up, together with lags in transmission, meant that Bank Rate needed to become less restrictive now. Waiting for lagging indicators of domestic relative price growth to fall sharply before reducing rates would come with a risk of overtightening. There might be potential upside risks from geopolitics. That said, consumer price inflation was already, and had been for some time, on a firm downward trajectory. Moreover, leading indicators, such as those from granular producer prices data, pointed to an easing in consumer prices. The outlook for demand remained weak, and less resilient than previously assumed, with vacancies falling more sharply than in some other advanced economies and consumption not having recovered to pre-pandemic levels. This further reduced the prospects of embedded persistence, shown in forward-looking indicators of domestic relative prices, such as monthly annualised rates of nominal pay growth and the Bank’s Agents’ surveys, and suggested lower pass-through of costs to prices. 19: The MPC remained prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It would, therefore, continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. On that basis, the Committee would keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level. 20: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 5.25%. 21: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Megan Greene, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members voted against the proposition. Two members (Jonathan Haskel and Catherine L Mann) preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. One member (Swati Dhingra) preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%. Operational considerations 22: On 31 January, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £738.0 billion, comprising £737.6 billion of UK government bond purchases and £0.4 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases. 23: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Ben Broadbent Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. David Roberts was also present on 24 and 26 January, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 20 March will be published on 21 March 2024.

At its meeting ending on 20 March 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 8–1 to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. One member preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, market-implied paths for advanced economy policy rates have shifted up. In the United States and the euro area, inflationary pressures have continued to abate, though by slightly less than expected. Material risks remain, notably from developments in the Middle East including disruption to shipping through the Red Sea. Having declined through the second half of last year, UK GDP and market sector output are expected to start growing again during the first half of this year. Business surveys remain consistent with an improving outlook for activity. The fiscal measures in Spring Budget 2024 are likely to increase the level of GDP by around ¼% over coming years. As the measures will probably also boost potential supply to some extent, the implications for the output gap, and hence inflationary pressures in the economy, are likely to be smaller. Reflecting uncertainties around the ONS’s Labour Force Survey, the Committee is continuing to consider a wide range of indicators of labour market activity. The labour market has continued to loosen but remains relatively tight by historical standards. Although still elevated, nominal wage growth has moderated across a number of measures. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents continue to expect some decline in pay settlements this year and to report greater difficulty in passing on cost increases to prices. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 3.4% in February from 4.0% in January and December, a little below the expectation in the February Monetary Policy Report. Services consumer price inflation has declined but remains elevated, at 6.1% in February. Most indicators of short-term inflation expectations have continued to ease. CPI inflation is projected to fall to slightly below the 2% target in 2024 Q2, marginally weaker than previously expected owing to the freeze in fuel duty announced in the Budget. In the February Report projection, CPI inflation was expected to increase slightly again in Q3 and Q4 , accounted for by the direct energy price contribution to 12-month inflation. Services price inflation is expected to fall back gradually. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Headline CPI inflation has continued to fall back relatively sharply in part owing to base effects and external effects from energy and goods prices. The restrictive stance of monetary policy is weighing on activity in the real economy, is leading to a looser labour market and is bearing down on inflationary pressures. Nonetheless, key indicators of inflation persistence remain elevated. Monetary policy will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term in line with the MPC’s remit. The Committee has judged since last autumn that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipates. The MPC remains prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It will therefore continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. On that basis, the Committee will keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 20 March 2024 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.4% in 2023 Q4, in line with the projection in the February Monetary Policy Report. The divergence in growth among advanced economies had continued, with the United States again growing faster than had been expected. 3: Euro-area GDP had been flat in 2023 Q4, in line with the February Report projection. Near-term indicators such as PMIs and industrial production had continued to stabilise, but the recovery was somewhat weaker than had been expected. By contrast, US GDP had grown by 0.8% in the fourth quarter, higher than had been anticipated in the February Report. US growth was expected to slow in 2024 Q1, following a weakening in real private consumption and retail sales growth since the start of the year. 4: In China, GDP had grown by 1.0% in 2023 Q4. Going forward, growth was expected to remain at around that rate and, in early March, the government had set an annual growth target of around 5%. Other emerging market economies had seen mixed GDP growth outturns in the fourth quarter, with India growing particularly strongly. Near-term indicators suggested that some momentum was persisting into 2024. 5: Despite the conflict in the Middle East and continuing disruption to shipping through the Red Sea, there had been limited news in energy prices since the MPC’s February meeting. The Brent spot oil price had increased by around 5% to $87 per barrel as OPEC and other aligned oil producers were expected to extend production cuts. European wholesale natural gas spot and near-term futures prices had been broadly flat since the Committee’s February meeting, as temperatures had remained mild and storage levels high. 6: Labour markets in advanced economies had continued to loosen but had remained tight overall. The job vacancies rate in particular had continued to decline across countries. The US unemployment rate had increased to 3.9% in February, while non-farm payrolls had grown by 275,000 in the same month. The unemployment rate in the euro area had edged down to 6.4% in January. Wage growth in the euro area and the United States had fallen in 2023 Q4 but data on the outcome of current wage negotiations in the euro area were not yet available. The gap in wage growth between the United Kingdom on the one hand, and the euro area and the United States on the other, had continued to narrow as UK wage growth had declined more quickly recently than wage growth in the other two economies. However, annual pay growth had remained higher in the United Kingdom. 7: Headline and core consumer price inflation had continued to trend down in the euro area and the United States since the start of this year. However, February inflation rates in both regions had been slightly higher than expected by market participants, accounted for by news in core inflation. In the euro area, headline HICP inflation had been 2.6% in February, and core inflation 3.1%. In the United States, headline CPI inflation had been 3.2%, and core inflation 3.8%. Services price inflation had remained elevated in both economies. 8: The Committee discussed some factors that might influence the global long-term real equilibrium interest rate. Factors that had previously been operating, such as demographics, were likely to continue to bear down on the long-term real rate. Increased investment into climate transition technologies or artificial intelligence, driven for example by expectations of higher productivity growth, might be raising the long-term real equilibrium interest rate. Sustained increases in fiscal spending could also have an impact. The Committee would continue to discuss these factors. Monetary and financial conditions 9: Since the Committee’s previous meeting, the market-implied paths for policy rates across major advanced economies had shifted up. Corporate bond spreads had, however, narrowed and equity prices had risen, leaving mixed signals on the direction of the overall change in financial conditions. 10: Following significant falls in market expectations of policy rates in December and January, recent stronger than expected economic data, particularly non-farm payrolls and inflation releases in the United States, had pushed out slightly the expected timing of future reductions in policy rates across major advanced economies. Despite the rise in short-term interest rates, risky asset prices had increased. Market intelligence suggested that the narrowing in corporate credit spreads and rising equity prices had reflected growing confidence that global growth, credit conditions and corporate earnings would improve going forward. 11: In line with market expectations, the Bank of Japan had raised its policy rate to positive territory and had also ended its policy of yield curve control . 12: In the United Kingdom, all respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) had expected Bank Rate to be left unchanged at this MPC meeting. They had also all continued to expect the next move in Bank Rate to be downward. The median respondent in the latest MaPS had expected a cumulative 75 basis points reduction in Bank Rate this year, starting in August. This was broadly in line with current market pricing but down from 100 basis points in the February MaPS. The median respondent had reported that they perceived the neutral interest rate to be at 3.25%, similar to recent surveys. 13: The Committee discussed the increasing convergence and correlated movements in recent months between market expectations for the UK and US policy rate paths. Market intelligence indicated that, despite differences in recent and projected supply and demand growth, this recent convergence could be attributed to factors such as the similarities in current policy rates and the two economies being in broadly similar stages of the disinflationary process. 14: While quoted mortgage rates had increased somewhat since the Committee’s previous meeting, largely reflecting pass-through of increases in risk-free reference rates, they had remained substantially below the levels reached last summer. The availability of secured lending to households had improved slightly in the latest Credit Conditions Survey, and the number of owner-occupied mortgage products advertised was now back at levels recorded before the start of the interest rate tightening cycle. Quoted interest rates on unsecured consumer credit and bank lending to businesses had remained close to their recent peaks. 15: The annual growth rate of aggregate sterling broad money had decreased from -0.3% in December to -1.6% in January, driven by volatility in the holdings of the non-intermediate other financial corporations sector, but had remained slightly above the previous six-month average of -1.8%. Within that, annual growth in household deposits had, however, continued to rise. Demand and output 16: UK real GDP had fallen by 0.3% in 2023 Q4, weaker than had been expected in the February Monetary Policy Report. This had followed a 0.1% decline in Q3. A Bank staff estimate of market sector output, which was less subject to swings in measured non-market output in health and education, had declined by 0.4% in Q4, after a similar-sized fall in Q3. Within the expenditure components of GDP, domestic household consumption and housing investment had fallen by 0.4% and 1.9% respectively in Q4. Business investment was estimated to have risen by 1.5%. 17: Monthly GDP had risen by 0.2% in January, to its highest level since September 2023. Strength in monthly growth had been concentrated in the construction and government services sectors. Private services output had risen slightly. 18: GDP and market sector output growth were both expected to pick up and be positive over the first half of the year. The flash S&P Global/CIPS UK composite output PMI had been little changed in March at slightly below its long-run historical average, while the future output PMI had eased back slightly from its two-year high in February. There was a similarly positive signal from most other business surveys of current and future market sector activity. Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents had also become slightly more optimistic about the outlook. Bank staff continued to expect GDP growth of 0.1% in 2024 Q1 and early indications suggested a small further rise in output growth in Q2. 19: Although consumption had been weaker than expected over 2023, there had been some early signs of a gradual recovery. Retail sales volumes had been volatile but had risen by 3.4% in January following a 3.3% decline in December. Intelligence from the Agents suggested that consumption growth was likely to remain weak in 2024 Q1 but to improve thereafter. GfK consumer confidence had been broadly stable over recent months, with the future personal financial situation sub-balance remaining only slightly below its long-run average. The number of mortgage approvals for house purchases had risen in January to its highest level since October 2022. The UK House Price Index had been broadly flat over recent months, but other timelier indicators of house prices had tended to rise slightly. 20: The Spring Budget 2024 had taken place on 6 March, accompanied by an Economic and fiscal outlook from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The Government had announced a package of fiscal measures, including a further 2p cut in the main rate of employee and self-employed national insurance contributions from April 2024. Bank staff had provisionally estimated that these new measures would increase the level of GDP by around ¼% over coming years. As the measures would probably also boost potential supply to some extent, the implications for the Committee’s output gap projection, and hence inflationary pressures in the economy, were likely to be smaller. A full assessment of this news would be conducted as part of the May Report forecast round. Supply, costs and prices 21: Reflecting uncertainties around the ONS’s Labour Force Survey (LFS), the Committee was continuing to consider a wide range of indicators of labour market activity. These collectively pointed to the labour market remaining relatively tight in absolute terms, though continuing to loosen. 22: The ONS had released updated LFS estimates in February but had advised caution in interpreting the results owing to low sample sizes. These estimates also did not reflect the most recent migration and population data. The LFS unemployment rate was estimated to have fallen over the past six months, to 3.9% in the three months to January. Other indicators, such as the claimant count and Agents’ intelligence on recruitment difficulties, pointed to a flat or slightly rising profile of unemployment. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio had remained slightly above its 2019 Q4 levels. 23: The collective steer from a range of measures pointed to modestly positive quarterly employment growth, in line with the February Monetary Policy Report projections. The Committee noted that employment growth had been relatively resilient in an environment of subdued activity, suggesting that companies were potentially retaining their existing employees to meet future increases in demand. This was also consistent with Agents’ intelligence. The Committee would monitor whether or not this retention would restrain any tightening in the labour market as GDP growth picked up. 24: Against the backdrop of easing labour market tightness and receding inflation expectations, most indicators of pay growth had declined, although they had remained elevated. Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth had been 6.1% in the three months to January, 1.1 percentage points lower than in the three months to October and broadly in line with the February Report projection. AWE had moved increasingly into line with other measures such as median private sector pay growth derived from HMRC payrolls data. 25: The Committee discussed the degree of persistence in wage growth. Some shorter-term measures of wage growth had eased, such as an underlying measure based on a range of pay indicators which had been running at a three-month on three-month annualised pace of around 5%, and suggested a moderation in inflationary persistence. On the other hand, adjusting AWE data on a CPI-weighted basis indicated that pay growth could be moderating at a slower pace than the headline data were suggesting. Some forward-looking indicators also pointed to slower moderation. Expectations for future wage growth from the Decision Maker Panel (DMP) Survey had remained flat at 5.2%. The latest intelligence on average pay settlements collected by the Agents had remained close to the levels observed in the Agents’ annual survey presented in the February Report. Agents’ contacts had generally expected lower pass-through of higher labour costs to prices compared to 2023, however. 26: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 3.4% in February from 4.0% in January and December, a little below the expectation in the February Report. The latest CPI release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. The decline in CPI inflation over recent months could largely be attributed to falls in food and core goods price inflation, as external cost pressures had continued to abate. Services price inflation had declined but remained elevated. 27: Energy prices had continued to drag on annual CPI inflation. Despite the 5% rise in the Ofgem price cap in January, energy was expected to continue to contribute negatively to CPI inflation over the next six months owing to the upcoming reduction in the price cap from April. The freeze in fuel duty announced in the Budget would provide a further marginal drag compared to the February Report projections. 28: Core goods price inflation had fallen to 1.9% in February, slightly lower than expected in the February Report, as cost pressures from previous shocks and global goods price inflation had continued to dissipate. Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation had also fallen, to 5.0% in February from 6.9% in January. The level of producer input and output prices for both core goods and food had receded significantly from their previous peaks over the past year and had then flattened, while Agents’ contacts similarly anticipated falling or flat input costs. 29: Services price inflation had remained higher than CPI inflation, at 6.1% in February, a decrease of 0.4 percentage points from January and in line with February Report expectations. Higher-frequency services price measures that excluded components that were not typically reliable indicators of trends in inflation persistence, such as rents, airfares, package holidays and education, had risen by around 4½% on a three-month on three-month annualised basis. The moderation of services price inflation in recent months appeared to have been accounted for largely by weakness in non-labour rather than labour costs. 30: Households’ median short-term inflation expectations had continued to ease in the February Bank of England Inflation Attitudes Survey, while longer-term expectations had remained steady and close to historical averages. Inflation expectations in the Citi/YouGov survey of households had remained somewhat higher than the Bank measures. The one-year ahead measure had been in decline, though had remained above historical averages, while the longer-term measure had been steadier. Business expectations looking one and three years ahead in the February DMP Survey had eased marginally compared to January but had remained above 2%. In the latest MaPS, median CPI expectations of market participants at the one-year point had fallen a little, while median expectations at the three and five-year horizons had remained unchanged at 2%. The immediate policy decision 31: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 32: In the MPC’s February Monetary Policy Report projections, GDP growth had been expected to pick up gradually during the forecast period. CPI inflation had been expected to fall temporarily to the 2% target in 2024 Q2 before increasing again in Q3 and Q4, to around 2¾%. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate at the time of the February Report, inflation had then been projected to remain above the 2% target over nearly all of the remainder of the forecast period, owing to persistence in domestic inflationary pressures. The Committee had judged that the risks around the modal inflation projection were skewed to the upside over the first half of the forecast period, stemming from geopolitical factors. Risks from domestic price and wage pressures had been judged to be evenly balanced. 33: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, market-implied paths for advanced economy policy rates had shifted up, including in the United Kingdom. 34: Having declined through the second half of last year, UK GDP and market sector output were expected to start growing again during the first half of this year. Business surveys remained consistent with an improving outlook for activity. Reflecting uncertainties around the ONS’s Labour Force Survey, the Committee was continuing to consider a wide range of indicators of labour market activity. The labour market had continued to loosen but remained relatively tight by historical standards. To the extent that companies had been retaining their existing employees to meet future increases in demand, employment growth was likely to be weaker relative to output growth in the near term, consistent with a further easing in labour market tightness. Should labour demand prove stronger, there could be less of an easing. 35: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 3.4% in February from 4.0% in January and December, a little below the expectation in the February Report. Services consumer price inflation had declined but remained elevated, at 6.1% in February. Higher-frequency measures of core services inflation, such as the three-month on three-month annualised rate, had been around 4½%. Most indicators of short-term inflation expectations had continued to ease. Although still elevated, nominal wage growth had moderated across a number of measures. An underlying measure based on a range of pay indicators had been running at a three-month on three-month annualised pace of around 5%. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents continued to expect some decline in pay settlements this year and to report greater difficulty in passing on cost increases to prices. CPI inflation was projected to fall to slightly below the 2% target in 2024 Q2, marginally weaker than had previously been expected owing to the freeze in fuel duty announced in the Budget. 36: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy would ensure that CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. 37: Monetary policy would need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term in line with the MPC’s remit. The Committee had judged since last autumn that monetary policy needed to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipated. The Committee recognised that the stance of monetary policy could remain restrictive even if Bank Rate were to be reduced, given that it was starting from an already restrictive level. 38: Eight members judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 5.25% was warranted at this meeting. Headline CPI inflation had continued to fall back relatively sharply in part owing to base effects and external effects from energy and goods prices. The restrictive stance of monetary policy was weighing on activity in the real economy, was leading to a looser labour market and was bearing down on inflationary pressures. Nonetheless, key indicators of inflation persistence remained elevated. 39: There was a range of views among these members on the extent to which the risks from persistent inflationary pressures had receded. At one end of this range, developments in nominal indicators, including at higher frequencies, suggested that the restrictive stance of policy and the unwinding of second-round effects associated with declining short-term inflation expectations were having a material impact in reducing the more persistent and slower-moving components of inflation. At the other end of this range, wage growth remained too high and was expected to moderate only slowly, as reflected in the Agents’ latest intelligence. There were limited signs so far that services price inflation would return to a target-consistent pace sufficiently rapidly, with evidence of diminishing second-round effects still tentative. Some upside risks remained around both the wage and CPI inflation projections. 40: For all of these members, a further accumulation of evidence on inflation persistence would be required to warrant a shift in the monetary policy stance, with members differing on the extent of evidence that was likely to be needed. They would continue to consider the degree of restrictiveness of policy at each meeting. 41: One member preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. For this member, waiting for more reassurance before reducing Bank Rate would weigh further on living standards and supply capacity. Bank Rate needed to become less restrictive now to enable a smooth transition in the policy stance and to account for lags in transmission. While this did not preclude the possibility of maintaining Bank Rate if upside risks were to materialise, consumer price inflation was already, and had been for some time, on a firm downward trajectory. Consumption had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels, in sharp contrast to some other advanced economies where it was driving economic growth. The outlook for demand remained weak, with vacancies falling sharply and forward-looking indicators of nominal pay growth easing. 42: The MPC remained prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It would therefore continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. On that basis, the Committee would keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level. 43: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 5.25%. 44: Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Megan Greene, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Swati Dhingra voted against the proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%. Operational considerations 45: On 20 March, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £729.9 billion, comprising £729.8 billion of UK government bond purchases and £0.1 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases. 46: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Ben Broadbent Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 8 May 2024 will be published on 9 May 2024.

At its meeting ending on 8 May 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Two members preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%. The Committee’s updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying May Monetary Policy Report and are conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that declines from 5¼% to 3¾% by the end of the forecast period, compared with an endpoint of 3¼% in February. Internationally, recent growth outturns have tended to be stronger in the United States than in the euro area. Underlying inflationary pressures in both regions have continued to moderate somewhat since the start of the year, though by less than expected in the United States. Forward interest rates have risen in the United States and, as a result, elsewhere. Following modest weakness last year, UK GDP is expected to have risen by 0.4% in 2024 Q1 and to grow by 0.2% in Q2. Despite picking up during the forecast period, demand growth is expected to remain weaker than potential supply growth throughout most of that period. A margin of economic slack is projected to emerge during 2024 and 2025 and to remain thereafter, in part reflecting the continued restrictive stance of monetary policy. With respect to indicators of inflation persistence, services consumer price inflation has declined but remains elevated, at 6.0% in March. There remains considerable uncertainty around statistics derived from the ONS Labour Force Survey. It is therefore more difficult to gauge the evolution of the labour market. Based on a broad set of indicators, the MPC judges that the labour market continues to loosen but that it remains relatively tight by historical standards. Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings growth declined to 6.0% in the three months to February, although that series tends to be volatile. Alternative indicators also suggest easing pay growth. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 3.2% in March from 3.4% in February. CPI inflation is expected to return to close to the 2% target in the near term, but to increase slightly in the second half of this year, to around 2½%, owing to the unwinding of energy-related base effects. There continue to be upside risks to the near-term inflation outlook from geopolitical factors, although developments in the Middle East have had a limited impact on oil prices so far. Conditioned on market interest rates and reflecting a margin of slack in the economy, CPI inflation is projected to be 1.9% in two years’ time and 1.6% in three years in the May Report. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Headline CPI inflation has continued to fall back, in part owing to base effects and external effects from goods prices. The restrictive stance of monetary policy is weighing on activity in the real economy, is leading to a looser labour market and is bearing down on inflationary pressures. Key indicators of inflation persistence are moderating broadly as expected, although they remain elevated. Monetary policy will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term in line with the MPC’s remit. The Committee has judged since last autumn that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipates. The MPC remains prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It will therefore continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. The Committee will consider forthcoming data releases and how these inform the assessment that the risks from inflation persistence are receding. On that basis, the Committee will keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 8 May 2024 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying May 2024 Monetary Policy Report . 2: The MPC discussed developments in consumer price inflation in the United States and in the euro area. In the United States, recent outturns had been higher than expected by market participants on both headline and core PCE inflation. The evidence suggested that this higher-than-expected inflation had reflected surprisingly strong domestic demand rather than inflation persistence. Euro-area inflation data had been more in line with market expectations, and demand had remained relatively subdued. The increased divergence in demand across regions could be consistent with a divergence in monetary policy, with potential implications for exchange rates and broader financial conditions. 3: Given this change in the perceived outlook for US demand and inflation, market participants had revised their expectations for US monetary policy since the MPC’s previous meeting, pushing out the expected timing and degree of future reductions in the federal funds rate. Alongside this, the market-implied path for policy rates in other major advanced economies, including the United Kingdom, had also shifted up materially, though by less. 4: The Committee discussed the degree to which these moves in UK interest rates had reflected global or domestic factors. This was not straightforward to separate out. The correlation between US and UK market interest rates had been near the top of its historical range, and the sensitivity of UK rates to both US and domestic data outturns had remained elevated. Nevertheless, market contacts had begun to judge that the increasing divergence of the US outlook from that of other major advanced economies could be reflected in their monetary policies in the near term. That said, contacts had expected that the influence of global factors could lead to greater macroeconomic and monetary policy convergence across major advanced economies beyond 2024. 5: In the United Kingdom, all but one of the respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) had expected Bank Rate to be left unchanged at this MPC meeting. They had also all expected the next move in Bank Rate to be downwards. The median expected profile for Bank Rate from MaPS implied a cumulative 75 basis point reduction in Bank Rate this year, similar to the profile from the March MaPS, despite the increase in the UK yield curve. 6: Turning to activity, UK GDP growth had strengthened since the start of the year, reversing the fall in output that was estimated to have occurred in the second half of 2023. The Committee expected the recovery in output to be underpinned by a pickup in household consumption, supported by higher real incomes. 7: The Committee discussed the risks around the near-term outlook for consumer spending. House price inflation had held up by more than had been expected, which could suggest upside risks to the outlook for spending. One potential explanation for this would be that higher interest rates had weighed on house prices by less than had been expected. Set against that, a modest expected rise in unemployment could pose downside risks to consumption, for example if those households not directly affected nevertheless chose to save more for precautionary reasons. 8: The Committee discussed the degree of persistence in UK wage growth and domestic price inflation. Consistent with the recent easing in short-term inflation expectations and a loosening in the labour market, wage growth had fallen somewhat further. Services consumer price inflation had also continued to ease. Although both wage growth and services price inflation had been slightly higher than expected in the February Monetary Policy Report, that difference was small in the context of typical data volatility. Both series still indicated elevated domestic inflationary pressures. 9: The Committee discussed the relative weights to put on different indicators of inflation persistence, particularly in the event that they were to give divergent signals in the future. There remained considerable uncertainty around estimates of labour market tightness derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), owing to small sample sizes. A range of labour market indicators, including the vacancies to unemployment ratio and survey indicators of recruitment difficulties, suggested that the labour market had continued to loosen, however, while remaining relatively tight by historical standards. 10: Although less severe than the issues surrounding the LFS, the Committee noted that the private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE) series tended to be volatile, especially when compared with services price inflation. While AWE growth had fallen sharply since last year, the decline suggested by other indicators appeared more gradual and from a lower peak. Possibly reflecting past falls in real wages and a relatively tight labour market, nominal pay growth had continued to be elevated. 11: The appropriate weight to place on different indicators of inflation persistence would also depend on wider economic developments. Depending on the expected path for demand, for example, indicators of inflation persistence might be expected to diverge. In an environment of subdued demand, firms might be expected to absorb higher wage growth into their profit margins. Higher wage growth would then not pass through to higher services price inflation. But as demand recovered, firms might choose to pass through that wage growth, resulting in higher services price inflation. Initial reports indicated that the Agents’ contacts generally expected lower pass-through of higher labour costs to prices than last year, owing to weaker demand. Consumer-facing services firms surveyed in the Decision Maker Panel in the three months to April had said that they expected to raise prices by 4.7% over the next year . The Committee would consider evidence from different indicators of persistence and would continue to monitor them in context. The immediate policy decision 12: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 13: Indicators of inflation persistence had evolved broadly as expected, albeit a little stronger than had been anticipated in the February Monetary Policy Report. 14: Services consumer price inflation had declined but remained elevated, at 6.0% in March. Higher-frequency measures of services price inflation showed somewhat more of a slowdown than annual rates but still indicated elevated domestic inflationary pressures. Services price inflation was expected to continue to ease gradually over the course of this year, as wage growth and indirect effects from energy and other goods prices weakened further. 15: There remained considerable uncertainty around statistics derived from the ONS Labour Force Survey. It was therefore more difficult to gauge the evolution of the labour market. Based on a broad set of indicators, the MPC judged that the labour market continued to loosen but that it remained relatively tight by historical standards. Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings growth had declined to 6.0% in the three months to February, although that series tended to be volatile. Alternative indicators also suggested easing pay growth. 16: The Committee noted that this year’s pay settlements, which tended to be concentrated in the early part of the year, would provide an important indication of the extent to which pay growth continued to moderate as expected. Firmer information on April settlements would soon become available, including from the Bank’s Agents’ intelligence. 17: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 3.2% in March from 3.4% in February, broadly as expected in the February Report. In the MPC’s May Report projections, CPI inflation was expected to return to close to the 2% target in the near term, but to increase slightly in the second half of this year, to around 2½%, owing to the unwinding of energy-related base effects. Conditioned on market interest rates and reflecting a margin of slack in the economy, CPI inflation was projected to be 1.9% in two years’ time and 1.6% in three years. 18: There continued to be upside risks to the modal CPI inflation projection from geopolitical factors during the first half of the forecast period, but the risks overall were more evenly balanced over the second half. 19: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy would ensure that CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. 20: Monetary policy would need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term in line with the MPC’s remit. The Committee had judged since last autumn that monetary policy needed to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipated. The Committee recognised that the stance of monetary policy could remain restrictive even if Bank Rate were to be reduced, given that it was starting from an already restrictive level. 21: Seven members judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 5.25% was warranted at this meeting. Headline CPI inflation had continued to fall back, in part owing to base effects and external effects from goods prices. The restrictive stance of monetary policy was weighing on activity in the real economy, was leading to a looser labour market and was bearing down on inflationary pressures. Key indicators of inflation persistence were moderating broadly as expected, although they remained elevated. There was a range of views among these members regarding the risks around the assumptions on persistence embodied in the May CPI projection. There was also a range of views about the extent of the evidence that was likely to be needed to warrant a change in Bank Rate, and the degree to which these members anticipated that incremental information in forthcoming data outturns would lead them to update materially their assessment of inflation persistence. All of these members would continue to consider the degree of restrictiveness of policy at each meeting. 22: Two members preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. For these members, Bank Rate needed to become less restrictive now to enable a smooth and gradual transition in the policy stance, and to account for lags in transmission. Consumer price inflation was already, and had been for some time, on a firm downward trajectory. The latest forecasts showed inflation returning close to the target in the short term, and this was consistent with forward-looking indicators of output price inflation falling behind input price inflation. As the outlook for demand remained subdued, with vacancies continuing to fall and nominal pay growth easing, the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the target in the medium term were to the downside. 23: The MPC remained prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It would therefore continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. The Committee would consider forthcoming data releases and how these informed the assessment that the risks from inflation persistence were receding. On that basis, the Committee would keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level. 24: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 5.25%. 25: Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Megan Greene, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted in favour of the proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden) voted against the proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%. Operational considerations 26: On 8 May, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was £703 billion, all of which were UK government bonds. The Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme had been fully unwound on 2 April, such that there were now no holdings of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bonds. 27: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Ben Broadbent Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. David Roberts was also present on 30 April and 2 May, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target.

At its meeting ending on 19 June 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Two members preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 2.0% in May from 3.2% in March, close to the May Monetary Policy Report projection. Indicators of short-term inflation expectations have also continued to moderate, particularly for households. CPI inflation is expected to rise slightly in the second half of this year, as declines in energy prices last year fall out of the annual comparison. UK GDP appears to have grown more strongly than expected during the first half of this year. Business surveys, however, remain consistent with a slower pace of underlying growth, of around ¼% per quarter. The considerable uncertainty around estimates derived from the ONS Labour Force Survey means that it is very difficult to gauge the evolution of labour market activity. Based on a broad set of indicators, the MPC judges that the labour market continues to loosen but that it remains relatively tight by historical standards. The collective steer from a range of indicators of aggregate pay growth has continued to ease in the latest data. Services consumer price inflation was 5.7% in May, down from 6.0% in March, but somewhat higher than projected in the May Report. This strength in part reflected prices that are index-linked or regulated, which are typically changed only annually, and volatile components. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%.

It will therefore continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. As part of the August forecast round, members of the Committee will consider all of the information available and how this affects the assessment that the risks from inflation persistence are receding. On that basis, the Committee will keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 19 June 2024 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have risen by 0.5% in 2024 Q1, in line with the projection in the May Monetary Policy Report. It was expected to continue to grow at a similar pace in Q2. Growth rates across advanced economies had converged as US growth had moderated. 3: Euro-area GDP had risen by 0.3% in 2024 Q1. The composite output PMI had reached a 12-month high in May, accounted for in part by the manufacturing sector. US GDP had also expanded by 0.3% in Q1. Growth in both regions was expected to continue at around this pace in Q2. 4: In China, GDP had grown by 1.6% in 2024 Q1, accounted for in part by strength in exports. In other emerging market economies, indicators of activity such as PMIs had seen healthy growth over this period, with particular strength in India. 5: Since the MPC’s May meeting, the Brent spot oil price had risen by 3% to around $85 per barrel. European wholesale natural gas spot prices had increased by 12%, with a smaller increase in futures prices. 6: Global shipping costs had risen since the MPC’s May meeting amid longer-than-expected disruptions to routes through the Red Sea, although these costs had remained well below their pandemic-era peak levels. In anticipation of constrained shipping capacity over the second half of the year, there were indications that producers were filling inventories sooner than usual. This higher demand combined with ongoing shipping capacity constraints had been pushing up on shipping rates, although there was uncertainty around the extent and timing of any potential effects on consumer prices. 7: Labour markets in advanced economies had remained tight overall. The US unemployment rate had increased to 4.0% in May and the vacancy rate had decreased in April, taking the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio closer to pre-Covid levels. However, non-farm payrolls growth had rebounded in May by more than had been expected by market participants, suggesting continued strength in the labour market. The euro-area unemployment rate had fallen to an historically low level of 6.4% in April. Wage pressures had remained elevated in both regions in 2024 Q1, with the wage growth component of the US employment cost index having ticked up slightly and negotiated wage growth rising to 4.7% in the euro area due to one-off payments. The Committee discussed the extent to which this wage strength could continue to push up on inflationary pressures in those regions. 8: Headline consumer price inflation in major advanced economies had continued to be somewhat above central banks’ targets over recent months, with services inflation remaining elevated. In the euro area, twelve-month HICP inflation had been 2.6% in May, while core inflation had risen to 2.9%, slightly higher than expected by market participants. Within this, services inflation had increased particularly strongly, in part due to base effects from German transport prices. US CPI inflation had fallen marginally to 3.3% in May, while core CPI inflation had fallen to 3.4%, both slightly below market expectations. Looking ahead, headline inflation was expected to continue to moderate in both economies, though to remain above inflation targets in 2024. Core services and shelter inflation were expected to decline at a slow pace in the United States, while energy-related base effects could lead to an uneven inflation profile in the euro area. Monetary and financial conditions 9: As in recent months, major advanced economy government bond yields had seen a relatively high degree of co-movement since the Committee’s previous meeting. Within that period, yields had moved in offsetting directions in response to macroeconomic data, in particular in the United States where the news from various indicators had been mixed. More recently, yields had been affected by uncertainty related to the forthcoming French election. Market-implied paths for policy rates across major advanced economies had generally ended the period somewhat lower than at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting, except for in the very near term. The sterling effective exchange rate had ended the period around 2% stronger. There had been greater divergence in risky asset prices across countries, where equity prices in Europe had fallen in response to political uncertainty, but those in the United States had increased somewhat. 10: At its meeting ending on 6 June, the ECB Governing Council had decreased its key policy rates by 25 basis points, in line with market expectations. In its statement, the Governing Council had noted that, despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures had remained strong, and had reiterated that it would follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach. Following the announcement, the market-implied path for subsequent cuts in euro-area policy rates in 2024 had fallen from 66 to 44 basis points. At its meeting ending on 12 June, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had left the federal funds rate unchanged, also in line with market expectations. The median FOMC member now expected that there would be one 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate in 2024, compared to three at the time of the March FOMC projections. 11: In the United Kingdom, Bank Rate expectations implied by market pricing had increased following the April CPI release, which had shown inflation higher than expected by both the MPC and market participants. All respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected Bank Rate to be left unchanged at this MPC meeting. MaPS respondents had all continued to expect the next move in Bank Rate to be downward, and the median profile had implied a cumulative 50 basis points reduction in Bank Rate this year, starting in August, although this was down from 75 basis points in the May MaPS. This contrasted somewhat with the path implied by market pricing, which had suggested that the first full 25 basis point cut would occur in November. 12: Medium-term inflation compensation measures in the United Kingdom had been little changed since the MPC’s previous meeting. 13: Regarding credit conditions, the 12-month growth rate of aggregate sterling net lending by banks had picked up slightly to 1.0% in April. Annual growth in net secured lending to households had picked up to a recent high, although it had remained well below rates seen before the start of the Bank Rate tightening cycle. Mortgage approvals on house purchases, an indicator of an earlier stage in the house-buying process, had fallen slightly in April after six months of consecutive increases. Quoted rates on fixed-rate mortgage products had been little changed since the MPC’s previous meeting. 14: The annual growth rate of aggregate sterling broad money had increased slightly to 0.4% in April. Within that, annual growth in household deposits had picked up further, reflecting a large inflow to ISAs in the most recent month. Demand and output 15: UK real GDP had increased by 0.6% in 2024 Q1, 0.2 percentage points stronger than had been expected in the May Monetary Policy Report. Just under half of that upside news had been accounted for by stronger government services output, which had tended to be volatile and subject to significant revision over recent quarters. Market sector output growth had also been somewhat stronger than expected, however. 16: Monthly GDP had been unchanged on the month in April, somewhat stronger than Bank staff expectations, which had been for a greater unwinding of the strength in Q1. Business-to-business services output had risen strongly, offsetting some weather-related weakness in other components of services and in the construction sector. 17: Bank staff now expected GDP growth of 0.5% in 2024 Q2 as a whole, stronger than the 0.2% rate that had been incorporated in the May Report. In light of this, the Committee discussed its view of the underlying trend in growth. The latest upside news to measured GDP over the first half of this year should be set against the surprisingly weak output data that had been observed during the second half of 2023. Recent indications from official data were stronger than an underlying rate of current output growth suggested by most business surveys, which had remained at around ¼% per quarter. Those surveys had nevertheless continued to signal that companies were expecting output growth to pick up further through the course of the year. For a given view of potential supply, this could suggest a risk that spare capacity in the economy might open up to a lesser degree than had been projected in the May Report. 18: Household consumption had increased by 0.2% in 2024 Q1, close to expectations in the May Report. Retail sales volumes had fallen sharply in April, in part reflecting weather-related volatility in spending. Real labour income had continued to pick up. Consumer confidence had also recovered further, with households continuing to view their own personal financial situations more positively. Nonetheless, perhaps reflecting the restrictive stance of monetary policy, households had remained sceptical about making major purchases and instead had favoured saving. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported a pickup in consumer demand in 2024 Q2 and were cautiously optimistic that growth could rise further over the course of this year. 19: Housing investment had been estimated to have grown by 4.1% in 2024 Q1, significantly stronger than had been expected in the May Report and perhaps indicating some easing in the impact that higher interest rates had been having. That upside surprise had reflected a continued upward trend in private housing repair and maintenance, alongside a small increase in new work after a period of pronounced weakness. The latest April housing construction output data had weakened for both of these components, in part potentially owing to adverse weather conditions. The UK House Price Index had risen over recent months. 20: Business investment had been estimated to have risen by 0.9% in 2024 Q1, with recent strength concentrated in spending on aircraft. The S&P Global/CIPS UK manufacturing investment goods output PMI had picked up recently, as had expected business investment growth in the Decision Maker Panel survey. Supply, costs and prices 21: The continuing labour market data quality issues were a matter of increasing concern. Owing to very low achieved sample sizes, Labour Force Survey (LFS)-based estimates of labour market dynamics were still subject to considerable uncertainties. Key labour market flows data had not yet been fully reintroduced. It was therefore difficult to gauge the underlying state of labour market activity. The MPC had for some time utilised a wide range of data to inform its judgements on the labour market, including official data, business surveys and intelligence from the Bank’s Agents. 22: The collective steer from a number of indicators, such as HMRC RTI payrolls employee data, a range of business surveys and the Bank’s Agents’ employment scores, pointed to underlying employment growth having slowed to broadly the same rate as population growth. This was in contrast to the LFS-based estimate of employment, which had reported a sharp decline. 23: The deceleration in underlying employment was in part likely to have reflected a further slowing in labour demand. The volume of vacancies had continued to fall back in May to around 10% above pre-Covid levels, although the pace of decline had slowed relative to last year. This decline in vacancies had been relatively broad-based across sectors, and a similar pattern had been reflected in the sectoral declines in demand for staff reported in the KPMG/REC survey. 24: In part reflecting this slowing labour demand, labour market tightness had continued to ease. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio had fallen further in the three months to April, returning to around pre-Covid levels, which were still high by historical standards. The Bank’s Agents’ contacts had reported that recruitment difficulties had eased to near to their pre-Covid levels, although this was also still a historically high level. The KPMG/REC survey had indicated that staff availability had increased further in May. Nonetheless, an indicator model of underlying unemployment, which extracted a signal from indicators such as the claimant count, vacancies, measures of recruitment difficulties and other household indicators, had pointed to the underlying unemployment rate having been relatively flat in recent quarters, implying that the labour market was a little tighter than official data suggested. The LFS measure of the unemployment rate had increased by 0.6 percentage points since 2023 Q4. 25: Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth had eased from 6.1% in the three months to January to 5.8% in the three months to April, in line with the expectation made at the time of the May Monetary Policy Report. April was traditionally an important month for pay setting, with around 40% of the year’s pay settlements taking effect alongside the annual increase in the National Living Wage. The collective steer from a range of pay growth indicators had continued to ease, with the staff’s updated forecast for 2024 Q2 remaining in line with the projection in the May Report of annual growth of just over 5%. 26: Nevertheless, some recent data suggested a risk that near-term pay growth could moderate by less than had been expected in the May Report. The Bank’s Agents’ contacts had reported that recent pay settlements for 2024 were slightly above the average level recorded in the Agents’ annual pay survey presented in the February Report. Contacts from those consumer-facing businesses that were most exposed to the National Living Wage had generally reported higher settlements. According to the Decision Maker Panel (DMP) survey in the three months to May, businesses’ expectations for annual pay growth a year ahead had eased slightly to a rate of 4.5%, which was nevertheless still elevated. A counterpoint to these upside risks were the KPMG/REC monthly pay growth indices, which had continued to suggest a downside risk to future pay growth. 27: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 2.0% in May from 3.2% in March. The decline in headline CPI inflation had been accounted for largely by base effects across both goods and services. The May outturn had been close to the expectation made at the time of the May Report, although downside news from core goods price inflation had somewhat offset upside news from services price inflation. 28: Consumer goods price inflation had continued to ease as the cost pressures from previous external shocks had dissipated further. Households’ domestic energy bills had continued to pull down headline inflation, declining at an annual rate of 27.1% in May. Food and non-alcoholic beverages price inflation had fallen to 1.7% in May compared to a peak of 19% in March 2023. Core goods price inflation had dropped to -0.1% in May, slightly below pre-Covid inflation rates. ONS producer price data had continued to point to easing cost pressures. Producer output and input price levels had been broadly flat in May, continuing a trend observed over the past year. The signals from other indicators, such as the S&P Global/CIPS manufacturing PMI input and output price indices and import prices, had also pointed to muted cost and price pressures for core goods. 29: The Committee discussed recent developments in indicators of consumer services price inflation and businesses’ price-setting behaviour. Services price inflation had eased to 5.7% in May from 6.0% in March. This was a somewhat higher outturn than had been expected at the time of the May Report, however. Higher-frequency measures of services price inflation had picked up in the three months to May. Some of this strength had been accounted for by components of the services basket that were index-linked or regulated, for which prices were typically changed in April and remained in the annual inflation rate for 12 months, as well as strength in some of the more volatile components of this basket such as accommodation services. The monthly annualised inflation rates of a seasonally adjusted services price measure, which excluded indexed and volatile components, rents and foreign holidays, had averaged 5¼% over the three months to May, close to its average since mid-2023. CPI microdata suggested that the share of services prices that had increased, a measure of price-setting behaviour, had continued to ease, although this share had remained elevated by historical standards. Evidence from the DMP survey suggested that businesses expected the frequency of services price increases to normalise somewhat further over the course of this year. The S&P Global/CIPS PMI services input price index had risen sharply in April but had fallen to close to its historical average in May. The corresponding output price index had declined to its lowest level in three years. 30: Evidence on how profit margins in consumer-facing services would evolve had been mixed. On the one hand, intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that consumer-facing services businesses were facing price-sensitive consumers and so would find it more challenging to maintain profit margins in the face of continuing cost pressures, including any from labour costs. On the other hand, the latest DMP survey data suggested that businesses in consumer-facing sectors, such as wholesale and retail, and food and accommodation had experienced flat or declining profit margins over the previous year and were expecting to maintain or even slightly increase these margins over the year ahead. This suggested that margin expansion would not add significantly to inflation above and beyond realised cost growth. 31: Staff expected CPI inflation to increase slightly in the second half of this year, owing largely to the smaller drag on 12-month inflation from domestic energy bills. 32: Indicators of households’ inflation expectations, an important channel of potential second-round effects on CPI inflation, had continued to moderate and had for the most part normalised to around their historical averages. The Bank of England/Ipsos Inflation Attitudes Survey’s measure of median short-term inflation expectations had fallen to 2.8% in May, marginally below its historical average. The corresponding measure of medium-term expectations had remained close to, but below, its historical average. The Citi/YouGov indicator of households’ short-term inflation expectations had eased to 3.1% in May, from 3.3% in April, but had remained slightly above its historical average. In contrast to developments in household measures, businesses’ own price expectations, as reported in the DMP survey, had remained at more elevated levels, albeit also on a continued downward path. The immediate policy decision 33: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 34: The Committee noted that the timing of the general election on 4 July was not relevant to its decision at this meeting, which would as usual be made on the basis of what was judged necessary to achieve the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term. 35: In the MPC’s May Monetary Policy Report projections, a margin of economic slack had been projected to emerge during 2024 and 2025 and to remain thereafter, in part reflecting the continued restrictive stance of monetary policy. CPI inflation had been expected to return to close to the 2% target in the near term, but to increase slightly in the second half of this year, to around 2½%, as declines in energy prices in the previous year fell out of the annual comparison. There had continued to be upside risks to the near-term inflation outlook from geopolitical factors. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate at the time of the May Report and reflecting a margin of slack in the economy, CPI inflation had been projected to be 1.9% in two years’ time and 1.6% in three years. 36: The Committee considered developments since the previous MPC meeting and how these informed the assessment that the risks from inflation persistence were receding. 37: UK GDP appeared to have grown more strongly than had been expected during the first half of this year. Business surveys, however, remained consistent with a slower pace of underlying growth, of around ¼% per quarter. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported a pickup in consumer demand in 2024 Q2 and most housing indicators had also shown signs of greater resilience over recent months. 38: The considerable uncertainty around estimates derived from the ONS Labour Force Survey meant that it was very difficult to gauge the evolution of labour market activity. Based on a broad set of indicators, the MPC judged that the labour market continued to loosen but that it remained relatively tight by historical standards. 39: The collective steer from a range of indicators of aggregate pay growth had continued to ease in the latest data, although there were some signs that this year’s increase in the National Living Wage (NLW) could be having a greater than expected impact. The Bank’s Agents’ contacts had reported that recent pay settlements for 2024 were slightly above the average level recorded in the Agents’ annual pay survey presented in the February Report. 40: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 2.0% in May from 3.2% in March, close to the May Report projection. Indicators of short-term inflation expectations had continued to moderate, particularly for households, which could have implications for future wage and price-setting decisions. 41: Services consumer price inflation had been 5.7% in May, down from 6.0% in March, but somewhat higher than had been projected in the May Report. This strength had in part reflected prices that were index-linked or regulated, which were typically changed only annually, and volatile components. Higher-frequency measures of services consumer price inflation had picked up in the three months to May. The S&P Global/CIPS PMI services input price index had risen sharply in April but had fallen back to close to its historical average in May. The corresponding output price index had declined to its lowest level in three years. 42: More generally, there continued to be a range of views regarding the risks of inflation persistence embodied in the CPI projection in the May Report. On the one hand, the continued unwinding of the past shocks to energy and other imported goods prices might moderate the extent to which employees and domestic firms would seek higher nominal pay and domestic selling prices to recover the reductions in real incomes that they had experienced in the past. As headline CPI inflation and short-term inflation expectations had fallen further, inflationary dynamics could therefore adjust as rapidly on the downside as they had done on the upside. On the other hand, there remained a risk that there had been a more enduring shift in price and wage-setting behaviour, perhaps associated with a higher degree of real income resistance or with changes in the relative wage structure. In addition, there was uncertainty around the near-term paths of demand and spare capacity in the economy, and hence around the extent to which these were likely to constrain domestic prices in the face of still-elevated cost pressures. 43: In contrast to the upside news in services consumer price inflation, core goods price inflation had been weaker than had been projected in the May Report. Although this series was often volatile, the downside news had been spread across several components of the goods basket and was consistent with broader developments in external cost pressures. 44: UK CPI inflation was expected to increase slightly in the second half of this year, as declines in energy prices last year fell out of the annual comparison. 45: The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy would ensure that CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. 46: Monetary policy would need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term in line with the MPC’s remit. The Committee had judged since last autumn that monetary policy needed to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipated. The Committee recognised that the stance of monetary policy could remain restrictive even if Bank Rate were to be reduced, given that it was starting from an already restrictive level. 47: Seven members judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 5.25% was warranted at this meeting. Headline CPI inflation had fallen back to the 2% target. The restrictive stance of monetary policy was weighing on activity in the real economy, was leading to a looser labour market and was bearing down on inflationary pressures. Key indicators of inflation persistence had continued to moderate, although they remained elevated. 48: There continued to be a range of views among these members about the extent of accumulated evidence that was likely to be needed to warrant a change in Bank Rate, and the degree to which incremental information was leading them to update materially their assessment of inflation persistence. 49: For some members within this group, the return of headline inflation to 2%, while welcome, was not necessarily indicative of the required sustained return to target. Continued high levels of, and upside news to, services inflation supported the view that second-round effects would maintain persistent upward pressure on underlying inflation. Wage growth had continued to exceed model-based estimates. Indicators of domestic demand were stronger than had been expected, and the risks to the outlook for activity were skewed to the upside. For these members, more evidence of diminishing inflation persistence was needed before reducing the degree of monetary policy restrictiveness. 50: For other members within this group, the upside news in services price inflation relative to the May Report did not alter significantly the disinflationary trajectory that the economy was on. This view was supported by evidence that the recent strength in services inflation included regulated and indexed components of the basket, and volatile components. The impact of the increase in the NLW this April on aggregate pay growth was unlikely to be as large in future. Such factors would not push up medium-term inflation. For these members, the policy decision at this meeting was finely balanced. 51: Two members preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. For these members, Bank Rate needed to become less restrictive now to enable a smooth and gradual transition in the policy stance, and to account for lags in transmission. CPI inflation had been on a firm downward trajectory for some time and had returned to the 2% target in May. It was forecast to stay close to 2% in the short term, consistent with the further easing in the labour market, forward-looking indicators of inflation and pass-through, and continued falls in inflation expectations. Given the subdued outlook for demand, the risks to inflation remaining sustainably at the target in the medium term were to the downside. 52: The MPC remained prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It would therefore continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. As part of the August forecast round, members of the Committee would consider all of the information available and how this affected the assessment that the risks from inflation persistence were receding. On that basis, the Committee would keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level. 53: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 5.25%. 54: Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Megan Greene, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted in favour of the proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden) voted against the proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%. Operational considerations 55: On 19 June, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was £696 billion. 56: Finally, on the occasion of his 128th and final meeting and on behalf of Committee members past and present, the Chair expressed his appreciation to Ben Broadbent for his contributions to the work of the MPC since becoming a member in 2011. 57: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Ben Broadbent Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Jonathan Haskel Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. David Roberts was also present on 12 and 17 June, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 31 July will be published on 1 August 2024.

The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. At its meeting ending on 31 July 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%. Four members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. The Committee has published an updated set of projections for activity and inflation in the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report. Twelve-month CPI inflation was at the MPC’s 2% target in both May and June. CPI inflation is expected to increase to around 2¾% in the second half of this year, as declines in energy prices last year fall out of the annual comparison, revealing more clearly the prevailing persistence of domestic inflationary pressures. Private sector regular average weekly earnings growth has fallen to 5.6% in the three months to May, and services consumer price inflation has declined to 5.7% in June. GDP has picked up quite sharply so far this year, but underlying momentum appears weaker. The Committee’s framework for assessing the medium-term outlook for inflation distinguishes between first and second-round effects. The MPC has been focused on second-round effects that capture more persistent inflationary pressures. The Committee continues to monitor the accumulation of evidence from a broad range of indicators. The Committee expects the fall in headline inflation, and normalisation in many indicators of inflation expectations, to continue to feed through to weaker pay and price-setting dynamics. A margin of slack should emerge in the economy as GDP falls below potential and the labour market eases further. Domestic inflationary persistence is expected to fade away over the next few years, owing to the restrictive stance of monetary policy. However, there is a risk that inflationary pressures from second-round effects will prove more enduring in the medium term. A stronger-than-expected path for demand, and structural factors such as a higher equilibrium rate of unemployment, could affect domestic wage and price-setting more persistently. Furthermore, the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy could be less than embodied in the Committee’s current assessment. In balancing these considerations, at this meeting, the Committee voted to reduce Bank Rate to 5%. It is now appropriate to reduce slightly the degree of policy restrictiveness. The impact from past external shocks has abated and there has been some progress in moderating risks of persistence in inflation. Although GDP has been stronger than expected, the restrictive stance of monetary policy continues to weigh on activity in the real economy, leading to a looser labour market and bearing down on inflationary pressures. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee continues to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 31 July 2024 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying August 2024 Monetary Policy Report . 2: Global activity was projected to have expanded steadily over recent quarters. US GDP had grown by 0.7% in 2024 Q2, somewhat stronger than had been expected. Euro-area GDP had grown by 0.3% in Q2, in line with expectations. Recent outturns for consumer price inflation in the United States and the euro area suggested some further normalisation toward central banks’ targets. 3: The Committee discussed developments in internationally traded goods prices, noting the presence of a range of risks that could be material for the UK inflation outlook. Although Chinese export prices had recently been higher than expected, they could pose a downside risk if past weakness were to re-emerge. That said, the effects on UK inflation would only be significant if competitive effects also generated spillovers to the price inflation of traded goods exported by other countries. Set against that, there were upside risks to goods prices from the risk of greater trade fragmentation and increased trade restrictions. A broadening of recent disruption to shipping routes could affect the supply of goods whose production was concentrated in particular regions. Upside risks to commodity prices from geopolitical developments, including from events in the Middle East, also remained. 4: The level of sterling was also likely to be an important driver of UK import prices. The effective exchange rate had appreciated further since the Committee’s previous meeting, such that it was over 3% higher than its level at the start of this year. The appreciation was likely to weigh on the outlook for UK import prices and inflation, all else equal, but the extent of pass-through was likely to depend on the underlying driver of the appreciation. 5: The market-implied path for Bank Rate was relatively little changed since the Committee's June meeting and the path that had been assumed in the May Monetary Policy Report. In the Bank's latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS), all respondents had expected the next move in Bank Rate to be downwards. Expectations on the timing of that move were finely balanced with a significant majority of respondents expecting the reduction to occur either at this MPC meeting or the subsequent one in September. That was consistent with market pricing for this meeting, which implied a close-to-evens probability of a 25 basis point reduction in Bank Rate. The median profile for Bank Rate in the August MaPS implied a cumulative 50 basis point reduction by the end of this year, unchanged from the June survey and also broadly in line with market pricing. 6: Turning to UK activity, GDP had grown by 0.7% in 2024 Q1, with that strength appearing to have continued into Q2. Growth in the first half of the year had been stronger than expected at the time of the May Report. Business surveys had continued to point to underlying growth of around 0.3% per quarter, somewhat weaker than headline GDP growth. 7: The Committee discussed the risks around the outlook for domestic demand, which were judged to be skewed to the upside. Households’ real income growth had continued to be supported by the reversal of the previous energy shock, although this had appeared to raise savings more than consumption so far. While flat retail sales volumes pointed to continued elevated savings, improvements in indicators such as the GfK major purchases balance suggested a risk that consumption growth could strengthen by more than had been expected in the projection in the August Report. As set out in Box C in the August Report, there was a risk that the impact of higher interest rates on spending had been more modest and would occur earlier than was expected in the Committee’s latest modal projections, suggesting upside risks to the outlook for spending. Set against that, corporate insolvency rates had continued to rise, although they had remained well below their historical averages. 8: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen back to the MPC’s 2% target in May and had remained at that level in June. Inflation was expected to increase to around 2¾% over the second half of this year, owing largely to a smaller expected drag from domestic energy bills. 9: The Committee discussed the latest accumulated evidence on the degree of persistence in pay growth and domestic price inflation. Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings growth had continued to fall back, albeit to a still elevated level, in line with the projection at the time of the May Report. The continued downward trajectory in pay growth had been driven by the normalisation of short-term inflation expectations and some further easing in labour market tightness, although pay growth had remained in excess of rates explained by Bank models. Services consumer price inflation had declined in 2024 Q2 but had remained elevated and had been higher than expected at the time of the May Report. The immediate policy decision 10: The Monetary Policy Committee sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. 11: The Committee had been briefed on the Government’s 29 July statement on immediate public spending pressures. The Government had announced that any changes in the stance of fiscal policy would be set out in the Budget on 30 October. These would be incorporated in the November Monetary Policy Report projections. 12: Twelve-month CPI inflation had returned to the MPC’s 2% target in May and June. CPI inflation was expected to increase to around 2¾% in the second half of this year, as declines in energy prices last year fell out of the annual comparison, revealing more clearly the prevailing persistence of domestic inflationary pressures. 13: The Committee’s framework for assessing the medium-term outlook for inflation distinguished between first and second-round effects. The MPC was focused on second-round effects that captured more persistent inflationary pressures. The Committee noted that there were several potential paths for inflation. 14: The Committee expected the fall in headline inflation, and normalisation in many indicators of inflation expectations, to continue to feed through to weaker pay and price-setting dynamics. A margin of slack should emerge in the economy as GDP fell below potential and the labour market eased further. Domestic inflationary persistence was expected to fade away over the next few years, owing to the restrictive stance of monetary policy. The modal projection in the August Monetary Policy Report was one representation of this. Conditioned on the market-implied path of interest rates, CPI inflation was projected to fall back to 1.7% in two years’ time and to 1.5% in three years. 15: However, there was a risk that inflationary pressures from second-round effects would prove more enduring in the medium term. A stronger-than-expected path for demand, and structural factors such as a higher medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment, could affect domestic wage and price-setting more persistently. Furthermore, the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy could be less than embodied in the Committee’s current assessment. This was reflected in the risks around the August Report modal inflation projection being skewed somewhat to the upside throughout the forecast period. Mean CPI inflation was projected to be 2.0% and 1.8% at the two and three-year horizons respectively. 16: The Committee also continued to monitor the accumulation of evidence from a broad range of indicators. 17: There remained considerable uncertainty around statistics derived from the ONS Labour Force Survey, making it more difficult to gauge the underlying state of labour market activity. Based on a broad set of indicators, the MPC judged that the labour market continued to loosen but that it remained relatively tight by historical standards. 18: Private sector regular average weekly earnings growth had fallen to 5.6% in the three months to May, in line with expectations in the May Report, and broadly in line with alternative indicators of wage growth. 19: Services consumer price inflation had been 5.7% in June, unchanged from May and stronger than had been expected in the May Report, but broadly as expected since the MPC’s previous meeting and lower than earlier in the year. 20: Following weakness in the second half of 2023, UK GDP growth had picked up sharply around the turn of the year and has been stronger than expected in the May Report. Business surveys had continued to point to weaker underlying GDP growth of around 0.3% per quarter. 21: Different members placed different probabilities on the extent to which the current restrictive policy stance would lead inflationary pressures to continue to unwind, or whether adverse inflationary dynamics would prove more enduring, possibly as a result of more structural factors or greater momentum in demand. The Committee recognised that the stance of monetary policy could remain restrictive even if Bank Rate were to be reduced from its current level. 22: Five members preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. It was appropriate to reduce slightly the degree of policy restrictiveness. The impact from past external shocks had abated and there had been some progress in moderating risks of persistence in inflation. There had been a normalisation in inflation expectations, and forward-looking indicators such as the Decision Maker Panel survey pointed to waning wage and price pressures. The recent strength in services inflation had in part continued to reflect more volatile components of this series. Although GDP had been stronger than expected, the restrictive stance of monetary policy continued to weigh on activity in the real economy, leading to a looser labour market and bearing down on inflationary pressures. For some of these members, the decision was finely balanced. Inflationary persistence had not yet conclusively dissipated, and there remained some upside risks to the outlook. 23: Four members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25% at this meeting. The upside news to services inflation and GDP outturns relative to the May Report, along with continued elevated wage growth, suggested that second-round effects were having a greater impact on wage and price-setting behaviour in the economy beyond what was embodied in the modal forecast. External factors, such as international food and energy prices, had played the major role in reducing headline inflation to date. By contrast, underlying domestic inflationary pressures appeared more entrenched. These members thought that there was a greater risk of more enduring structural shifts, such as a rise in the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment, a fall in potential growth and a rise in the long-run neutral interest rate, contributing to domestic inflationary persistence. They preferred to maintain the current level of Bank Rate until there was stronger evidence that these upside pressures would not materialise. 24: Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee continued to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. 25: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%. 26: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Clare Lombardelli and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Four members (Megan Greene, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted against the proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Operational considerations 27: On 31 July, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was £690 billion. 28: As discussed in Box A in the August Monetary Policy Report, the Committee would vote on the target for the reduction in the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes over the 12-month period from October 2024 to September 2025 at its September 2024 meeting. 29: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Jonathan Haskel Clare Lombardelli Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. David Roberts was present on 23 and 29 July, and Jonathan Bewes on 29 July, as observers for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in their roles as members of the Bank’s Court of Directors. 30: On behalf of the Committee, the Chair expressed his appreciation to Jonathan Haskel for his contributions to the work of the MPC since becoming a member in 2018. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target.

The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. At its meeting ending on 18 September 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 8–1 to maintain Bank Rate at 5%. One member preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.75%. The Committee voted unanimously to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes, and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £100 billion over the next 12 months, to a total of £558 billion. Monetary policy decisions have been guided by the need to squeeze persistent inflationary pressures out of the system so as to return CPI inflation to the 2% target both in a timely manner and on a lasting basis. Policy has been acting to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored. As set out at the time of the August Monetary Policy Report, the Committee’s deliberations have been supported by the consideration of a range of cases, to which different probabilities and different risks can be attached. In the first case, the unwinding of the global shocks that drove up inflation and the resulting fall in headline inflation should continue to feed through to weaker pay and price-setting dynamics. The persistence of inflationary pressures would therefore dissipate with a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than in other cases. In the second case, a period of economic slack, in which GDP falls below potential and the labour market eases further, may be required in order for pay and price-setting dynamics to normalise fully. Domestic inflationary persistence would then be expected to fade away, owing to the opening up of slack from a more restrictive stance of monetary policy relative to the first case. In the third case, the economy may be subject to structural shifts such as changes in wage and price-setting following the major supply shocks experienced over recent years. The degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy may be less than embodied in the Committee’s latest assessment, meaning that monetary policy would have to remain tighter for longer. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, global activity growth has continued at a steady pace, although some data outturns suggest greater uncertainty around the near-term outlook. Oil prices have fallen back, reflecting in large part weaker demand. Market-implied paths for policy rates across major advanced economies have declined. There has generally been limited news in UK economic indicators relative to the Committee’s expectations in the August Monetary Policy Report. Headline GDP growth is expected to return to its underlying pace of around 0.3% per quarter in the second half of the year. Twelve-month CPI inflation was 2.2% in August, and is expected to increase to around 2½% towards the end of this year as declines in energy prices last year fall out of the annual comparison. Services consumer price inflation remained elevated at 5.6% in August. Private sector regular average weekly earnings growth declined to 4.9% in the three months to July. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5%. In the absence of material developments, a gradual approach to removing policy restraint remains appropriate. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee continues to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 18 September 2024 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decisions, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 1: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.5% in 2024 Q2, broadly in line with the projection in the August Monetary Policy Report, and consistent with steady growth over recent quarters. US GDP had grown more strongly than had been anticipated, while GDP growth had moderated in the euro area and in China in the second quarter. 2: In the third quarter, euro-area GDP growth was expected to be a little weaker than had been anticipated in the August Report, and US GDP growth was expected to moderate somewhat, in line with previous expectations. Activity indicators such as PMIs suggested ongoing weakness in the manufacturing sector in both economies over recent months, while the services sector had continued to expand. 3: Labour market outturns in the United States had been softer in July and August relative to previous months. Unemployment in the euro area had remained low, pointing to some continuing tightness. Wage growth had continued to moderate across both regions. 4: Headline consumer price inflation had declined further towards central bank targets in the euro area and in the United States. In the euro area, 12-month HICP inflation had been 2.2% in August, while core inflation had ticked down to 2.8%, in line with market participants’ expectations. US CPI inflation had fallen to 2.5% in August, while core CPI inflation had remained unchanged at 3.2%, also in line with market expectations. Annual services price inflation had remained elevated in both economies, although higher frequency measures pointed to some easing over recent months. 5: There were tentative signs of a shift in the balance of risks to global activity towards the downside. Consistent with that, since the MPC's previous meeting, the Brent spot oil price had declined by around 6%, to $75 per barrel. Market contacts had ascribed the moves largely to weaker demand in China, as indicators of domestic demand there had continued to be soft. Monetary and financial conditions 6: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, government bond yields had fallen across major advanced economies in response to the softening in US labour market data and associated FOMC communications. Market-implied paths for policy rates across economies had generally ended the period lower. Coupled with UK data releases in that period having been largely in line with market expectations, that meant UK interest rate movements had been driven primarily by developments in the United States. Nevertheless, the UK market-implied path had fallen by less than in the United States. That had been associated with an appreciation of sterling against the dollar of 3%, which had accounted for most of the 1% increase in the sterling effective exchange rate since the previous MPC meeting. 7: Movements in yields across major advanced economies had been particularly pronounced early in August, alongside large moves in asset prices more generally. Market-specific factors including seasonally low market liquidity were likely to have exacerbated reactions to news. While these early August moves had unwound quickly, yields across countries had nevertheless ended the period lower. In contrast, UK equity prices had been little changed since the MPC’s previous meeting and the S&P 500 and Euro Stoxx 50 had both increased somewhat. 8: At its meeting on 12 September, the ECB Governing Council had reduced its key policy rate by 25 basis points, in line with market expectations. In its statement, the Governing Council had reiterated its data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach, focused on the inflation outlook and strength of policy transmission. At its meeting ending on 18 September, the FOMC was expected to reduce the federal funds rate by either 25 or 50 basis points. 9: In the United Kingdom, Bank Rate expectations implied by market pricing had continued to suggest that the next 25 basis point cut would occur in November. That was consistent with the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS). Beyond November, while the median MaPS profile implied a slightly slower pace of reduction in Bank Rate than the market-implied path, both pointed to much more gradual reductions than were expected in the United States and to a lesser extent in the euro area. 10: Regarding credit conditions, it was too soon to assess fully the extent to which the Bank Rate reduction in August had passed through to the relevant saving and borrowing rates facing households and corporates. Nevertheless, as had been anticipated, mortgage rates had fallen since the MPC’s previous meeting broadly in line with declines in risk-free reference rates. 11: The share of two-year fixed-rate mortgages within new secured household lending had been increasing since 2023 Q1, despite rates on these mortgages being above five-year fixed rates over this period. That had reversed the previous trend whereby longer-duration mortgage fixes had increased in popularity since 2016, probably reflecting household expectations of lower interest rates. Slow mortgage stock turnover meant that the share of five-year fixed-rate mortgages in outstanding lending had remained historically high. 12: Household saving preferences had also adjusted over the past year, as rates offered on time deposits had become relatively less attractive, reflecting the declines in risk-free reference rates. Deposit flows had shifted into sight deposits and ISAs, many of which were instant access. Household deposits had continued to be the main driver of aggregate sterling broad money growth. The latter had increased to 1.6% on an annual basis in July, but had remained weak by historical standards. Demand and output 13: UK GDP had increased by 0.6% in 2024 Q2, 0.1 percentage points lower than had been expected in the August Monetary Policy Report. That had followed 0.7% growth in Q1, but Bank staff judged that the underlying pace of growth had been somewhat weaker during the first half of the year. 14: Within the expenditure components of Q2 GDP, household consumption had risen by 0.2% on the quarter, while business and housing investment had both declined by 0.1%. Real government expenditure had increased by 1.6%, and there had continued to be some evidence of greater-than-projected central government spending in recent public sector finances data. 15: GDP had been unchanged on the month in both July and June but had grown by 0.5% on a three-month-on-three-month basis in July. Slightly weaker-than-expected output in July had been concentrated in the manufacturing and professional services sectors. 16: Bank staff now expected GDP growth of 0.3% in 2024 Q3, marginally weaker than the 0.4% rate that had been incorporated in the August Report. That was broadly in line with estimates of the underlying growth rate that had been extracted from models based on a range of business survey indicators and on disaggregated GDP data. The latest intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that improving real incomes, the August Bank Rate reduction and anticipated further cuts in interest rates had underpinned improved sentiment and expectations of increased activity across most sectors around the turn of the year. 17: There had been little news from most indicators of consumer spending, although housing market data had strengthened somewhat. Retail sales volumes had been volatile, around a very gradually rising trend since the start of the year. GfK consumer confidence had been unchanged in August. Forward-looking indicators in the housing market had continued to point to a recovery in home buyer enquiries and prices, while mortgage approvals for house purchase had increased to their highest level since September 2022. 18: The Committee discussed the near-term outlook for activity and the evolution of the output gap. Although uncertainties surrounded this assessment, overall demand and supply were judged to have been broadly in balance over recent quarters. A continuation of the current pace of underlying GDP growth would, given the Committee’s view of potential supply growth, be consistent with little change in the output gap through the end of this year. That path was a little stronger than the August Report projections, however, in which demand growth had been expected to slow at the end of this year and a significant margin of spare capacity had been projected to open up over time. That projection in part reflected the previously announced medium-term tightening in the stance of fiscal policy, prior to the upcoming Budget. The Committee would also continue to monitor closely how the different channels of the monetary transmission mechanism were interacting with the dynamics of the household saving ratio, and in turn the outlook for consumer demand. Supply, costs and prices 19: Labour market data quality issues continued to be an area of concern. Very low achieved sample sizes meant Labour Force Survey (LFS)-based estimates of labour market dynamics remained subject to considerable uncertainties. This was making it difficult to gauge the underlying state of labour market activity. The MPC had, for some time, utilised a wide range of data to inform its judgements on the labour market, including official data, business surveys and intelligence from the Bank’s Agents. 20: A Bank staff indicator model of underlying employment continued to point to growth of around 0.2% per quarter, broadly in line with population growth. There was greater dispersion among outturns from individual employment indicators. The KPMG/REC/S&P Global UK Report on Jobs had continued to point to a contraction in employment while the Lloyds Business Barometer suggested an expansion. 21: In line with softening labour demand, vacancies had continued to fall back gradually, although at a slower pace than in 2023 and they had remained above pre-pandemic levels. The REC Report and Agents’ intelligence signalled a continued easing in recruitment difficulties, with the latter suggesting improved job retention in some sectors. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio had returned to its pre-pandemic average at the start of 2024 Q2. A Bank staff indicator model suggested that underlying unemployment had increased steadily over the past few quarters, in contrast to more volatile LFS data. 22: Indicators of households’ inflation expectations had largely normalised to close to their historical averages. The Bank of England/Ipsos Inflation Attitudes Survey’s measure of median short-term inflation expectations had fallen to 2.7% in August. The corresponding measure of medium-term expectations had remained close to, but below, its historical average. The Citi/YouGov indicator of households’ short-term inflation expectations had increased slightly to 3.1% in August from 2.7% previously, possibly owing to media reports of a rise in the Ofgem utility price cap in October. Businesses’ own price expectations, as reported in the DMP Survey, had remained at slightly more elevated levels, although on a continued downward path. 23: This normalisation in inflation expectations, as well as, to a lesser extent, the easing in labour market tightness, had supported continued moderation in pay growth. Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings growth had eased to 4.9% in the three months to July from 5.3% in the three months to June, broadly in line with August Monetary Policy Report projections. Other surveys suggested that wage growth would continue to moderate, although remain above inflation target-consistent levels, with the DMP Survey indicating a fall to approximately 4% over the next year. The latest Agents’ intelligence indicated that pay settlements over the second half of the year were, as expected, coming in at lower rates compared to H1, and 2025-expected settlements might be in a 2 to 4% range. There remained the possibility of some upside risk to pay growth depending on the trajectory of the National Living Wage (NLW) in the first half of next year. 24: Twelve-month CPI inflation had been 2.2% in August and July, slightly lower than August Report expectations. Consumer core goods and food price inflation had remained subdued as the cost pressures from previous global shocks had unwound further, and producer price levels had been broadly flat. Energy prices had continued to drag on CPI inflation. 25: Services price inflation had increased to 5.6% in August compared to 5.2% in July and 5.7% in June. This was slightly lower in August than had been expected at the time of the August Report. There had been volatility in a number of services sub-components in the July and August outturns, including accommodation and catering prices and airfares. 26: The Committee discussed momentum in services price inflation and price-setting behaviour in firms. Strength in services price inflation was supported by evidence from the DMP Survey which showed firms’ own-price inflation continuing to fall, but to a lesser extent among services firms. July CPI microdata pointed to a higher proportion of services prices being raised each month than was the case pre-Covid, though with some easing in catering services where food input costs had moderated. The monthly annualised inflation rates of a seasonally adjusted services price measure, which excluded indexed and volatile components, rents and foreign holidays, had averaged around 4% in the three months to August, close to its average since the end of 2023. Although it had fallen from its peak level, the apparent stability in this measure suggested further pass-through from lower labour costs and easing inflation expectations was still to come. Accordingly, Bank staff expected services inflation to ease slightly further in Q4. 27: CPI inflation was expected to increase somewhat over the remainder of this year, owing to the smaller drag on 12-month inflation from domestic energy bills. The announced uptick in utility prices to take effect in October was likely to be offset somewhat by the recent decrease in petrol prices. The immediate policy decisions 28: The Monetary Policy Committee sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. 29: Monetary policy decisions had been guided by the need to squeeze persistent inflationary pressures out of the system so as to return CPI inflation to the 2% target both in a timely manner and on a lasting basis. Policy had been acting to ensure that inflation expectations remained well anchored. As set out at the time of the August Monetary Policy Report, the Committee’s deliberations had been supported by the consideration of a range of cases, to which different probabilities and different risks could be attached. 30: In the first case, the unwinding of the global shocks that had driven up inflation and the resulting fall in headline inflation should continue to feed through to weaker pay and price-setting dynamics. The persistence of inflationary pressures would therefore dissipate with a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than in other cases. 31: In the second case, a period of economic slack, in which GDP fell below potential and the labour market eased further, might be required in order for pay and price-setting dynamics to normalise fully. Domestic inflationary persistence would then be expected to fade away, owing to the opening up of slack from a more restrictive stance of monetary policy relative to the first case. 32: In the third case, the economy might be subject to structural shifts such as changes in wage and price-setting following the major supply shocks that had been experienced over recent years. The degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy might be less than embodied in the Committee’s latest assessment, meaning that monetary policy would have to remain tighter for longer. 33: The Committee continued to monitor the accumulation of evidence from a broad range of indicators, with a focus on the extent to which it was possible over time to use developments in data series to assess the various cases. 34: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, global activity growth had continued at a steady pace, although some data outturns suggested greater uncertainty around the near-term outlook. Oil prices had fallen back, reflecting in large part weaker demand. Market-implied paths for policy rates across major advanced economies had declined. 35: There had generally been limited news in UK economic indicators relative to the Committee’s expectations in the August Monetary Policy Report. Headline GDP growth was expected to return to its underlying pace of around 0.3% per quarter in the second half of the year. Based on a broad set of indicators, the MPC judged that the labour market continued to loosen but that it remained tight by historical standards. 36: Twelve-month CPI inflation had been 2.2% in August, and was expected to increase to around 2½% towards the end of this year as declines in energy prices last year fell out of the annual comparison. Services consumer price inflation had remained elevated at 5.6% in August. Private sector regular average weekly earnings growth had declined to 4.9% in the three months to July. Households’ inflation expectations had largely normalised to close to their historical averages, although businesses’ inflation expectations had remained at slightly more elevated levels. Bank Rate decision 37: Different members took different views on the probabilities and risks associated with the various cases that the Committee was considering, which were informing their votes on Bank Rate. 38: Eight members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 5% at this meeting. Wage and price-setting had continued to normalise and UK activity growth had been broadly in line with expectations, although there was some greater uncertainty around the near-term global outlook. There was a range of views among these members on the degree to which the unwinding of past global shocks, the normalisation in inflation expectations and the current restrictive policy stance would lead underlying domestic inflationary pressures to continue to unwind, or whether these pressures could prove more entrenched, possibly as a result of more structural factors or greater momentum in demand. Despite these differences of view, the current policy stance was judged to be appropriate. For most members, in the absence of material developments, a gradual approach to removing policy restraint would be warranted. 39: One member preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. Bank Rate needed to become less restrictive now to enable a smooth and gradual transition in the policy stance, and to account for lags in transmission. CPI inflation had been on a firm downward trajectory for some time. Data developments remained consistent with CPI inflation staying sustainably at target, given the further easing in the labour market, continued falls in inflation expectations and forward-looking indicators of pass-through, and the subdued outlook for demand. 40: Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee continued to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. 41: The MPC would make a full assessment of recent and prospective developments as part of its forthcoming November forecast round. Annual decision on the pace of reduction in the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes 42: As set out in the minutes of its August 2022 meeting, the MPC had committed to review the reduction in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) annually and, as part of that, to set an amount for the reduction in the stock of purchased UK government bonds (gilts) over the subsequent 12-month period. Box A of the August 2024 Monetary Policy Report had set out an assessment of the process of quantitative tightening over the previous year. 43: The Committee continued to judge that reducing the size of the APF had the benefit of reducing the risk of a ratchet upwards in the size of the Bank’s balance sheet over time, and thus should increase the headroom and flexibility available to the Bank to use its balance sheet in the future if needed. 44: The appropriate pace of gilt stock reduction would continue to be guided by a set of key principles, which the MPC had first outlined in the August 2021 Monetary Policy Report. First, the Committee intended to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Second, sales would be conducted so as not to disrupt the functioning of financial markets. Third, to help achieve that, sales would be conducted in a gradual and predictable manner over a period of time. 45: As set out in the Box in the August 2024 Report, the Committee judged that quantitative tightening had continued to proceed smoothly. There was no evidence of a negative impact of gilt sales on market functioning across a range of financial market measures. In particular, measures of gilt market liquidity had further improved. APF reduction was likely to have had some tightening effect on yields, which, while difficult to measure precisely, was judged to have been modest. That was in line with the MPC’s previous expectations, and was broadly consistent with findings from other empirical studies and central banks. The Committee would continue to learn from monitoring developments as the process progressed. 46: While it remained hard to measure precisely the marginal effect of quantitative tightening on the economy, the MPC’s forecasts were conditioned on asset prices that incorporated announced and expected APF reductions. The MPC had therefore taken this effect into account when setting the desired monetary policy stance using Bank Rate. Any tightening effect from the reduction in the APF would have led to a slightly lower path for Bank Rate, all else equal. Given that the impact of APF reduction was judged to have been modest, this was unlikely to have made a material difference to the appropriate path for Bank Rate over the past year. 47: The Committee considered the case to maintain the pace of gilt stock reduction at £100 billion over the 12 months ahead, of which £87 billion would be maturing APF gilt holdings. Bank staff had briefed the MPC on the current state of economic and market conditions. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) had also been briefed on the MPC’s deliberations. 48: All members of the MPC agreed at this meeting that the Bank of England should reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes, and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £100 billion over the 12-month period from October 2024 to September 2025, comprising both maturing gilts and sales. 49: The MPC also reaffirmed that there would be a high bar for amending the planned reduction in the stock of purchased gilts outside a scheduled annual review. That was in order to remain consistent with the principles that Bank Rate should be the active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and that APF reduction should be predictable. In judging whether that bar was met, the FPC would also have a role through its assessment of financial stability. 50: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 5%; and The Bank of England should reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes, and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £100 billion over the next 12 months, to a total of £558 billion. 51: Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted in favour of the first proposition. Swati Dhingra voted against this proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.75%. 52: The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the second proposition. Operational considerations 53: On 18 September 2024, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was £659 billion. 54: At this meeting, the MPC had voted to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes by £100 billion over the 12-month period from October 2024 to September 2025. The details of the first quarter of the associated gilt sales programme, covering 2024 Q4, were set out in a Market Notice accompanying these minutes. The Bank would continue to set auction sizes each quarter, to meet the MPC’s annual target as closely as practicable. 55: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Clare Lombardelli Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Alan Taylor Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. David Roberts was present on 12 September, and Jonathan Bewes on 16 September, as observers for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in their roles as members of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 6 November will be published on 7 November 2024.

The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. At its meeting ending on 6 November 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 8–1 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.75%. One member preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 5%. There has been continued progress in disinflation, particularly as previous external shocks have abated, although remaining domestic inflationary pressures are resolving more slowly. CPI inflation fell to 1.7% in September but is expected to increase to around 2½% by the end of the year as weakness in energy prices falls out of the annual comparison. Services consumer price inflation has declined to 4.9%. Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings growth has continued to fall but remained elevated at 4.8% in the three months to August. Headline GDP growth is expected to fall back to its recent underlying pace of around ¼% per quarter over the second half of this year. The MPC judges that the labour market continues to loosen, although it appears relatively tight by historical standards. Monetary policy has been guided by the need to squeeze remaining inflationary pressures out of the economy to achieve the 2% target both in a timely manner and on a lasting basis. The Committee’s deliberations have been supported by the consideration of a range of cases that could impact the evolution of inflation persistence. These three cases are set out further in the accompanying November Monetary Policy Report. In the first case, most of the remaining persistence in inflation may dissipate quickly as pay and price-setting dynamics continue to normalise following the unwinding of the global shocks that drove up inflation. In the second case, a period of economic slack may be required to normalise these dynamics fully. In the third case, some inflationary persistence may also reflect structural shifts in wage and price-setting behaviour. Each case would have different implications for how quickly the restrictiveness of monetary policy could be withdrawn. The MPC’s latest projections for activity and inflation are also set out in the accompanying November Report. This forecast is based on the second case. CPI inflation is projected to fall back to around the 2% target in the medium term, conditioned on the usual 15 day average of forward interest rates, as a margin of slack emerges later in the forecast period that acts against second-round effects in domestic prices and wages. The combined effects of the measures announced in Autumn Budget 2024 are provisionally expected to boost the level of GDP by around ¾% at their peak in a year’s time, relative to the August projections. The Budget is provisionally expected to boost CPI inflation by just under ½ of a percentage point at the peak, reflecting both the indirect effects of the smaller margin of excess supply and direct impacts from the Budget measures. There remains significant uncertainty around the outlook for the labour market. Data are difficult to interpret and wage growth has been more elevated than usual relationships would predict. The impact of the Budget announcements on inflation will depend on the degree to and speed with which these higher costs pass through into prices, profit margins, wages and employment. At this meeting, the Committee voted to reduce Bank Rate to 4.75%, reflecting the continued progress in disinflation. Based on the evolving evidence, a gradual approach to removing policy restraint remains appropriate. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee continues to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 6 November 2024 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying November 2024 Monetary Policy Report . 2: The Committee discussed the near-term global risks and their potential impact on the inflation outlook in the United Kingdom. The balance of risks to global activity, particularly stemming from China and Germany, remained to the downside in the near term. Alongside that, there were upside risks to goods and commodity prices from greater trade fragmentation and adverse geopolitical developments, including from events in the Middle East. 3: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, the market-implied path for Bank Rate in the United Kingdom had shifted up materially. For the period prior to Autumn Budget 2024, market intelligence had attributed the modest upward moves in the market-implied path largely to international factors such as stronger-than-expected economic data in the United States. For the period around the time of the Budget, the upward shift had been more material. However, market pricing had continued to remain consistent with a 25 basis point reduction in Bank Rate at this MPC meeting. 4: Bank staff continued to judge that the economy was growing at around ¼% per quarter on an underlying basis. According to the official data, GDP had grown by 0.5% in 2024 Q2, 0.2 percentage points weaker than had been expected in the August Report, and 0.1 percentage points weaker than the earlier outturn had indicated at the time of the MPC’s previous meeting. Through the second half of 2024, GDP was projected to grow at a somewhat slower rate than in Q2. 5: The Committee discussed the implications of the latest activity data for the evolution of slack in the economy. There was limited evidence that aggregate demand was falling short of aggregate supply. Surveys of capacity utilisation had remained close to their historical averages, and indicators of labour market tightness, while easing of late, continued to appear relatively tight by historical standards. These developments reinforced the view that the drag on activity from the lagged transmission of past monetary tightening was unlikely to intensify over the coming year. 6: There had been material news to the economic outlook in Autumn Budget 2024. Taken together, the fiscal policy announcements were provisionally expected to boost the level of GDP by around ¾% at their peak in a year’s time, relative to the August projections. The Committee also discussed the increase in the overall cost of employment that was likely to follow from the changes to employers’ National Insurance contributions (NICs) and the increase in the National Living Wage (NLW), and the degree to and speed with which that increase might be transmitted into prices, profit margins, wages and employment. 7: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 1.7% in September. The decline in CPI inflation since the start of this year had primarily reflected lower goods price inflation, with disinflation in underlying services prices having been less pronounced. Services price inflation had, however, decreased quite sharply to 4.9% in September. Most of this downside news had been concentrated in more volatile categories, and some of this was expected to unwind. Services price inflation was expected to remain broadly unchanged over the next six months. Annual growth in private-sector regular average weekly earnings had fallen back significantly since mid-2023, but it had remained relatively strong at 4.8% in the three months to August. The immediate policy decision 8: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. 9: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, there had been continued disinflation. Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 1.7% in September. The decline in CPI inflation since the start of the year had primarily reflected lower goods price inflation, with disinflation in underlying services prices less pronounced. 10: Annual growth in private sector regular average weekly earnings had fallen back significantly since mid-2023 but had remained relatively strong at 4.8% in the three months to August. Year-ahead expectations for wage growth in the DMP Survey had been flat at around 4% since May, while initial Agents’ intelligence had reported an expected range of pay awards between 2% and 4% next year. 11: GDP had grown by 0.5% in 2024 Q2, slightly weaker than had been expected in the August Report. GDP growth was expected to fall back to its recent underlying pace of around ¼% per quarter over the second half of the year. 12: The combined effects of the measures announced in Autumn Budget 2024 were provisionally expected to boost the level of GDP by around ¾% at their peak in a year’s time, relative to the August projections. The Budget was provisionally expected to boost CPI inflation by just under ½ of a percentage point at its peak, reflecting both the indirect effects of the smaller margin of excess supply and direct impacts from the Budget measures. 13: Based on the collective steer from a wide range of indicators, the MPC judged that the labour market continued to ease but that it appeared relatively tight by historical standards. However, there was significant uncertainty around the labour market outlook and its impact on inflationary persistence. The combined effect of some policies announced in the Budget, particularly the increase in employer NICs and the NLW, was likely to increase the overall costs of employment. The net effect of this news on aggregate inflation would depend on the degree to and speed with which those costs would be transmitted into prices, wages, employment, or otherwise absorbed in profit margins or productivity growth. On the one hand, higher labour costs could constrain firms’ cash-flows if there was limited pass-through to pricing. This in turn could moderate wage growth and further loosen the labour market through reduced labour demand. On the other hand, the increase in labour costs could prove more inflationary if upward pressure on prices were passed on to consumers. 14: The Committee continued to monitor the accumulation of evidence from a broad range of indicators of inflation persistence, including evidence that could point to the three cases set out in the November Monetary Policy Report having begun to materialise. In the first case, most of the remaining persistence in inflation might dissipate quickly as pay and price-setting dynamics continued to normalise following the unwinding of the global shocks that drove up inflation. In the second case, a period of economic slack might be required to normalise these dynamics fully. In the third case, some inflationary persistence might reflect structural shifts in wage and price-setting behaviour. 15: In the November forecast, which was based on the second case, second-round effects in domestic prices and wages were expected to take somewhat longer to unwind than they did to emerge. The margin of slack that emerged later in the forecast period would act against those second-round effects, leading CPI inflation to fall back to around the 2% target in the medium term. 16: If, for example, the economy were to grow broadly as expected, but material downside news to wages and services inflation were nonetheless to emerge, this could increase the weight that the MPC would place on the first case materialising. Signs of a slowing in the disinflation process, particularly in the absence of a pickup in activity growth, could instead increase the likelihood that the MPC would place on the third case materialising. 17: At this meeting, eight members preferred to reduce Bank Rate to 4.75%. There had been continued progress in disinflation, particularly as previous external shocks had abated, although remaining domestic inflationary pressures were resolving more slowly. These members put different probabilities on and risks around the three cases, but they believed that a cut in Bank Rate was appropriate at this meeting. They would continue to assess the range of evidence over time. 18: One member preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 5%. For this member, structural factors in wage and price-setting dynamics continued to draw out the underlying disinflation process, and CPI inflation was projected to remain above the 2% target until the end of the forecast period. Wage developments might continue to be more robust than projected as firms and workers incorporated past and upcoming adjustments in the National Living Wage and National Insurance contributions. This, along with prospects for more robust demand associated with the Budget, was likely to support pricing opportunities for firms. In the face of these uncertainties, maintaining the current level of Bank Rate would allow time to evaluate whether these upside pressures would materialise. 19: Based on the evolving evidence, a gradual approach to removing policy restraint remained appropriate. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. 20: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.75%. 21: Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted in favour of the proposition. Catherine L Mann voted against the proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 5%.

The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. At its meeting ending on 18 December 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 6–3 to maintain Bank Rate at 4.75%. Three members preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.5%. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, twelve-month CPI inflation has increased to 2.6% in November from 1.7% in September. This was slightly higher than previous expectations, owing in large part to stronger inflation in core goods and food. Services consumer price inflation has remained elevated. Headline CPI inflation is expected to continue to rise slightly in the near term. Although household inflation expectations have largely normalised, some indicators have increased recently. Most indicators of UK near-term activity have declined. Bank staff expect GDP growth to have been weaker at the end of the year than projected in the November Monetary Policy Report. The Committee now judges that the labour market is broadly in balance. Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings growth picked up quite sharply in the three months to October, but has tended to be more volatile than other wage indicators. The latest Agents’ intelligence suggests that average pay settlements in 2025 will be within a range of 3 to 4%. There remains significant uncertainty around developments in the labour market. Monetary policy has been guided by the need to squeeze remaining inflationary pressures out of the economy to achieve the 2% target both in a timely manner and on a lasting basis. Over recent quarters there has been progress in disinflation, particularly as previous external shocks have abated, although remaining domestic inflationary pressures are resolving more slowly. The Committee continues to consider a range of cases for how the past global shocks that drove up inflation may unwind, and therefore how persistent domestic inflationary pressures may be. The MPC is also monitoring the impact on growth and inflationary pressures from the measures announced in the Autumn Budget, and from geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainty. These developments have generated additional uncertainties around the economic outlook. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4.75%. The Committee continues to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and will assess the extent to which the evolving evidence is consistent with more constrained supply, which could sustain inflationary pressures, or with weaker demand, which could lead to the emergence of spare capacity in the economy and push down inflation. A gradual approach to removing monetary policy restraint remains appropriate. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 18 December 2024 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.5% in 2024 Q3, marginally higher than the projection in the November Monetary Policy Report. On balance, the risks around the near-term outlook for activity in a number of advanced economies remained to the downside. Euro-area GDP had grown by 0.4% in the third quarter, higher than the November Report projections and supported by household consumption. Growth was expected to slow in Q4, however, in line with weakness in the output PMIs, particularly in France and Germany. US GDP had increased by 0.7% in Q3, in line with the November Report projections, and was expected to cool slightly in Q4. In China, GDP had grown by 0.9% in Q3, a rebound from Q2, owing to stronger exports. Growth was expected to recover further, partly supported by additional policy stimulus. 3: The euro-area labour market had remained tight but had continued to normalise, while the labour market in the United States had remained close to balance. Unemployment in these regions remained at or near historical lows. Indicators of pay growth had generally cooled in the euro area, albeit with an increase in negotiated wage growth in 2024 Q3 that was attributable largely to one-off payments in Germany. Recent indicators of wage growth in the United States had been mixed. 4: Headline consumer price inflation in advanced economies had increased slightly, close to market expectations. In the euro area, twelve-month HICP inflation had increased to 2.2% in November, accounted for largely by an energy-related base effect, while core inflation had remained unchanged at 2.7%. In the United States, PCE inflation had risen slightly to 2.3% in October, while core PCE inflation had also increased slightly to 2.8%. These increases had been accounted for partly by core services excluding housing. 5: Since the MPC’s November meeting, European wholesale gas prices had initially increased sharply, owing to colder weather, strong demand from Asia and disruption in the provision of Russian-owned gas supplies. These price increases had largely reversed by the time of the MPC’s December decision. 6: The Committee discussed risks to global growth and inflation stemming from geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainty, with indicators of the latter having increased materially. The incoming US administration had proposed to increase tariffs in a manner that could influence future global trade if applied and, as a result, have some direct and indirect impacts on the UK economy. The magnitude and direction of any such impacts would depend on a range of factors that were at present unknown, including the total package of economic policies to be delivered in the United States, their timing and any subsequent policy responses from other countries. Monetary and financial conditions 7: Market-implied paths for policy rates in the United States and euro area had ended the period since the MPC’s previous meeting a little lower. That reflected, in particular, weaker-than-expected global activity data. Corporate bond spreads were little changed across these economies, while equity prices had increased slightly. At its meeting on 12 December, the ECB Governing Council had reduced its key policy rate by 25 basis points, in line with market expectations. At its meeting ending on 18 December, the FOMC was expected to reduce the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. 8: In the United Kingdom, near-term market expectations for Bank Rate had increased since the MPC’s previous meeting, predominantly reflecting stronger-than-expected wage data. The sterling effective exchange rate was little changed. Within that, sterling had depreciated by 2% against the dollar, offsetting an appreciation against the euro of around 1%. 9: More generally, market expectations for policy rates in the United Kingdom and United States had increasingly diverged from the euro area since September. The euro-area path had shifted down and had become more steeply downward sloping, while the UK and US paths had shifted up and had become shallower. In the United Kingdom and United States, rates were expected to be around 3.75 to 4% in three years’ time, compared with 2% in the euro area. 10: The August and November Bank Rate reductions, and associated changes in other risk-free reference rates, had continued to pass through to the relevant saving and borrowing rates facing households and corporates, broadly in line with historical experience. The main exception had been household sight deposit rates, which had fallen by less and more slowly than Bank Rate since August. Historically, such reductions in Bank Rate had been associated with full and fairly rapid pass-through to sight deposit rates, although these rates had not risen by as much as Bank Rate during the most recent tightening cycle. 11: Housing market activity had continued to pick up, with mortgage approvals for house purchase having risen back to their pre-pandemic average in October. That reflected, in part, declines in the average rate paid on new mortgages since quoted rates had peaked in mid-2023. Over the same period, however, the average rate paid on all outstanding mortgages had continued to increase as the majority of fixed-term mortgages were refinanced on to higher rates. As noted in the November Financial Stability Report, 37% of fixed rate mortgage accounts had not yet re-fixed since rates had started to rise in 2021 H2, so the full impact of higher interest rates had not yet passed through to all mortgagors. 12: Household broad money balances had grown unusually strongly in October. There had been evidence of deposits flowing to households from Non-Intermediary Other Financial Companies, which included asset managers, insurance companies and pension funds. Recent overall trends in broad money had been little changed, however, with annual growth in M4ex increasing only slightly to 3.4%. The ratio of household money to gross domestic income remained close to its pre-pandemic trend. Demand and output 13: UK GDP had risen by 0.1% in 2024 Q3, slightly weaker than the 0.2% that had been expected in the November Monetary Policy Report. Within the expenditure components, household consumption had been estimated to have grown by ½%, and government spending and business investment had each risen by around 1%. 14: GDP had declined by 0.1% in October after a similar-sized fall in September. Manufacturing output had contracted by 0.6% in October, while services output had been flat on the month. Market sector output had now fallen back to around a level that had last been observed in April. 15: Most indicators of near-term activity had weakened since the previous MPC meeting. For example, the S&P Global/CIPS UK composite output PMI had fallen back to just over 50 in November and had remained at that level in the December flash release, and there had also been declines in the future output and new orders indices. Both the services and manufacturing PMIs had fallen in recent months, suggesting that a mixture of domestic and global factors was at play. The Bank’s Agents had reported that there had been some further deterioration in business sentiment since the previous MPC meeting and that activity was subdued currently, although it was still expected to pick up across the economy next year. In this context, it was notable that sales outcomes reported in the DMP Survey had consistently come in lower than companies’ expectations of their sales one-year ahead. In contrast to most other indicators, consumer confidence had increased slightly over recent months, though remained below its historical average, and most housing market indicators had been fairly robust. 16: Bank staff now expected zero GDP growth in 2024 Q4, weaker than the 0.3% that had been incorporated in the November Report. That was broadly consistent with the latest combined steer from business surveys and the available official data. 17: The Committee discussed the extent to which recent developments in output could reflect the weakness of both demand and supply, such that there might be fewer implications for the margin of spare capacity in the economy and thus domestic inflationary pressures. There was also uncertainty around how the measures that had been announced in the Autumn Budget were affecting growth. This included the extent to which companies would, over time, take account of the indirect spillovers to private demand from higher public spending, as well as the direct consequences of the increase in employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) that would take effect from April. Supply, costs and prices 18: Low response rates had continued to impart considerable uncertainty to Labour Force Survey (LFS)-based estimates of labour market quantities. In its latest reweighting of key LFS variables, the ONS had incorporated upward revisions to the estimated population of around half a million people. Separately, the ONS had revised up its estimates of net inward migration by over 400,000 people, although that would not be reflected in the LFS for some time. Taken together, these revisions could close around half of the gap between the level of employment implied by pre-revision LFS data and that implied by alternative measures such as workforce jobs. The corollary of these upward revisions to employment would be more pronounced weakness in labour productivity. However, the LFS revisions had had only minimal implications for the historical profile of the underlying rate of unemployment. 19: At a higher frequency, other indicators of unemployment had exhibited some dispersion, but there had been little evidence of a significant increase during the period since the November Monetary Policy Report. Household surveys of job security and advanced notifications of potential redundancies had remained consistent with little net change in the underlying unemployment rate. 20: Vacancies had continued to fall, albeit at a slower pace than in 2023. Bank staff analysis of the difference between the observed ratio of vacancies to unemployment and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment that might be consistent with equilibrium in the labour market, after taking account of, for example, changes in the cost of posting vacancies over time, suggested that the labour market was now broadly in balance. This analysis, which was corroborated by other indicators from the Agents and in the REC survey, signalled less tightness in the current labour market than a simple historical view of the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio would imply. 21: The uncertainty surrounding developments in key labour market quantities and measured labour productivity would limit the extent to which the Committee would be able to draw firm conclusions in its next regular stocktake of the short to medium-term supply capacity of the economy. This was being undertaken ahead of the February Monetary Policy Report. 22: Annual growth in private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE) had risen from 4.8% in the three months to August to 5.4% in the three months to October. This upside surprise had reflected a combination of greater-than-expected strength on the month and revisions to prior months. Base effects from the previous year would push annual rates of private sector regular AWE growth closer to 6% in 2024 Q4, but this measure of pay growth had often exhibited more volatility than comparable survey-based measures. 23: The signal from most indicators following the announced increases in the National Living Wage (NLW) and employer National Insurance contributions tended to corroborate the view that, supported by diminishing churn, easing recruitment difficulties and an ongoing loosening of the labour market, annual private sector wage growth would slow over the policy-relevant horizon. The Agents’ intelligence available since the Autumn Budget, for example, suggested that firms in aggregate expected pay settlements in 2025 to sit within a range of 3 to 4%. This was slightly higher than the 2 to 4% range reported before the Budget, but lower than the 5½% average reported in 2024. The latest evidence from the DMP Survey was also consistent with a softening in wage growth across all sectors, albeit to a plateau of around 4% in aggregate over the year ahead. Expected wage growth in consumer services companies, in particular, had remained elevated at around 5%. 24: Across surveys, firms had reported that their response to higher employer NICs would involve multiple types of adjustment, of which pay growth was but one. In the DMP Survey, for example, higher prices and lower employment were both cited more frequently than lower wages. Moreover, a more granular disaggregation of the results of the DMP Survey suggested that firms with greater exposure to the NLW would be less likely to respond to higher NICs by paying lower wages. These firms would be more likely to respond to higher NICs by raising prices, accepting lower profit margins and/or laying off existing workers. 25: Twelve-month CPI inflation had increased to 2.6% in November from 1.7% in September. This was slightly higher than previous expectations, owing in large part to stronger inflation in core goods and food. Core CPI inflation had increased to 3.5%. 26: Annual services price inflation had been 5.0% in November, little changed from its rate in October and September. The three-month moving averages of annualised monthly increases in a range of underlying services prices had edged higher in November, but had remained lower than their corresponding annual rates. The extent of domestically generated disinflation to date, however, had remained relatively modest. 27: In the near term, headline CPI inflation was expected to continue to rise slightly. 28: Although indicators of households’ inflation expectations had largely normalised through the first half of this year, short-term expectations had begun to increase again in the latest data. The Bank of England/Ipsos Inflation Attitudes Survey’s measure of median one-year ahead inflation expectations had risen to 3.0% in November. The measure of medium-term expectations in the same survey had now edged above its historical average. The Citi/YouGov indicator of households’ short-term inflation expectations had risen over several months to 3.5%, even while realised CPI inflation had eased. Businesses’ own price expectations, as reported in the DMP Survey, had remained consistent with only a modest decline in inflation over the coming year, particularly in consumer-facing services sectors. 29: The latest increases in inflation expectations might reflect greater attentiveness among households to cost-of-living increases, such as the reduction in winter fuel payments, higher bus fares and vehicle excise duty, successive increases in the Ofgem price cap in October and January, and higher food prices. These increases might interact with already-elevated inflation perceptions, and thus could add to the persistence of domestic inflationary pressures. The immediate policy decision 30: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. 31: Monetary policy had been guided by the need to squeeze remaining inflationary pressures out of the economy to achieve the 2% target both in a timely manner and on a lasting basis. Over recent quarters there had been progress in disinflation, particularly as previous external shocks had abated, although remaining domestic inflationary pressures were resolving more slowly. 32: As set out in the November Monetary Policy Report, the Committee’s deliberations had been supported by the consideration of a range of cases that could impact the evolution of inflation persistence. In the first case, most of the remaining persistence in inflation might dissipate quickly as pay and price-setting dynamics continued to normalise following the unwinding of the global shocks that had driven up inflation. In the second case, a period of economic slack might be required to normalise these dynamics fully. In the third case, some inflationary persistence might also reflect structural shifts in wage and price-setting behaviour. Each case would have different implications for how quickly the restrictiveness of monetary policy could be withdrawn. 33: The MPC was also considering the impact on growth and inflationary pressures from the measures announced in the Autumn Budget, and from geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainty. These domestic and global developments had generated additional uncertainties around the economic outlook. 34: As set out in the November Report, the combined effects of the measures announced in the Budget were provisionally expected to boost the level of GDP by around ¾%, and CPI inflation by just under ½ of a percentage point, at their peaks relative to the August projections. However, there remained significant uncertainty around how the economy might respond to higher overall costs of employment, including from the increase in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage. 35: The Committee noted that indicators of trade policy uncertainty had increased materially, but that the magnitude and the direction of the impact of any such policies on UK inflation was at present unclear. These effects might not be apparent for some time. 36: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, most indicators of UK near-term activity had declined. Bank staff were expecting zero GDP growth in 2024 Q4, weaker than had been projected in the November Monetary Policy Report. Several components of the December S&P Global/CIPS UK flash PMI had fallen, including the new orders and employment indices. Other indicators of employment growth had been more mixed. 37: Although there remained significant uncertainty around developments in labour market quantities derived from the Labour Force Survey, the Committee now judged that the labour market was broadly in balance based on a wider range of evidence. The number of job vacancies had continued to fall, albeit at a slower pace than in 2023. There had also been a decline in indicators of labour market tightness from the Agents and in the REC survey. 38: Annual private sector regular AWE growth had picked up quite sharply in the three months to October, to 5.4%, which was ½ of a percentage point stronger than had been expected in the November Report. AWE growth had tended to be more volatile than other wage indicators, however. The latest Agents’ intelligence suggested that average pay settlements in 2025 would be within a range of 3 to 4%. 39: Twelve-month CPI inflation had increased to 2.6% in November from 1.7% in September, slightly higher than previous expectations. Services consumer price inflation had remained elevated, at 5.0%, while core goods price inflation had risen to 1.1%. Food consumer price inflation had picked up slightly over recent months, to 2%. Some other indicators of goods price inflation had increased, including in the December S&P Global/CIPS UK flash PMI. Headline CPI inflation was expected to continue to rise slightly in the near term. 40: Although household inflation expectations had largely normalised, some indicators had increased recently, in part reflecting developments in energy and food prices as well as other more idiosyncratic factors. Businesses’ own price expectations had remained consistent with only a modest decline in inflation over the coming year, particularly in consumer-facing services sectors. Monetary policy was acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. 41: At this meeting, six members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.75%. Most indicators of UK near-term activity had weakened, but CPI inflation, wage growth and some indicators of inflation expectations had risen, adding to the risk of inflation persistence. The macroeconomic implications of the higher costs of employment facing companies remained particularly uncertain. Against a backdrop over recent years of a repeated sequence of negative supply shocks, incoming data would help to clarify the potential trade-off between more persistent inflationary pressures and greater weakness in output and employment. For five of these members, recent developments added to the argument for a gradual approach to the withdrawal of policy restrictiveness, while eschewing any commitment to changing policy at a specific meeting. For the other member, the evolution of and prospects for disaggregated measures of activity and inflation could warrant an activist strategy. 42: Three members preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. The most recent data developments pointed to sluggish demand and a weakening labour market, now and in the year ahead, both of which would see further downward pressure on demand, wages, and prices. In the short run, these factors, alongside higher uncertainty and weak global conditions, paired with the temporary uptick in headline inflation entailed a policy trade-off. In the medium term, a continued stance that was very restrictive risked deviating unsustainably from the 2% inflation target and opening an unduly large output gap. Given the evolving balance of risks, a less restrictive policy rate was warranted. 43: The Committee continued to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and would assess the extent to which the evolving evidence was consistent with more constrained supply, which could sustain inflationary pressures, or with weaker demand, which could lead to the emergence of spare capacity in the economy and push down inflation. A gradual approach to removing monetary policy restraint remained appropriate. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. 44: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 4.75%. 45: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members (Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted against the proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.5%. Operational considerations 46: On 18 December 2024, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was £655 billion. 47: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Clare Lombardelli Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Alan Taylor Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative.

The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. At its meeting ending on 5 February 2025, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.5%. Two members preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 4.25%. There has been substantial progress on disinflation over the past two years, as previous external shocks have receded, and as the restrictive stance of monetary policy has curbed second-round effects and stabilised longer-term inflation expectations. That progress has allowed the MPC to withdraw gradually some degree of policy restraint, while maintaining Bank Rate in restrictive territory so as to continue to squeeze out persistent inflationary pressures. CPI inflation was 2.5% in 2024 Q4. Domestic inflationary pressures are moderating, but they remain somewhat elevated, and some indicators have eased more slowly than expected. Higher global energy costs and regulated price changes are expected to push up headline CPI inflation to 3.7% in 2025 Q3, even as underlying domestic inflationary pressures are expected to wane further. While CPI inflation is expected to fall back to around the 2% target thereafter, the Committee will pay close attention to any consequent signs of more lasting inflationary pressures. GDP growth has been weaker than expected at the time of the November Monetary Policy Report, and indicators of business and consumer confidence have declined. GDP growth is expected to pick up from the middle of this year. The labour market has continued to ease and is judged to be broadly in balance. Productivity growth has been weaker than previously estimated, and the Committee judges that growth in the supply capacity of the economy has weakened. As a result, the recent slowdown in demand is judged to have led to only a small margin of slack opening up. In support of returning inflation sustainably to the 2% target, the Committee judges that there has been sufficient progress on disinflation in domestic prices and wages to reduce Bank Rate to 4.5% at this meeting. Based on the Committee’s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint is appropriate. In addition to the risks around inflation persistence, there are also uncertainties around the trajectories of both demand and supply in the economy that could have implications for monetary policy. Should there be greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, this could push down on inflationary pressures, warranting a less restrictive path of Bank Rate. If there were to be more constrained supply relative to demand, this could sustain domestic price and wage pressures, consistent with a relatively tighter monetary policy path. The Committee will continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evolving evidence may reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 5 February 2025 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying February 2025 Monetary Policy Report . 2: The Committee discussed recent global economic developments, and in particular the extent to which these had been reflected in yield curves across advanced economies. During the current monetary policy cycle, the level of US and UK three-year forward rates, had been closer to each other than to the equivalent euro-area rates. The gap between the US and UK curves relative to the euro-area curve had widened materially over the previous six months or so, as US and UK rates had increased. Market intelligence suggested that the upward movement in US yields over this period had in part reflected expectations of a more inflationary policy mix, with the possible implementation of tariffs, looser fiscal policy and tighter controls on migration by the new US administration. 3: In the days leading up to the MPC’s policy decision, the US administration had made various announcements on trade tariffs, to which some other governments had responded. The Committee noted that this was a rapidly evolving situation, which it would be monitoring closely, and that the ultimate impact would depend on the final composition of policies, as discussed in Box C of the February Report. Nevertheless, there had already been an increase in economic uncertainty globally and a pickup in financial market volatility. 4: Market intelligence suggested that developments in the United States had influenced recent movements in UK government bond yields, alongside domestic factors. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, the market-implied path for Bank Rate in the United Kingdom had first risen and then fallen back, ending the period somewhat lower in aggregate. Almost all respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) were expecting a 25 basis point reduction in Bank Rate at this MPC meeting, in line with market pricing. The median MaPS respondent expected 100 basis points of Bank Rate cuts this year, albeit with the overall distribution skewed towards fewer cuts, consistent with the market-implied path declining by around 85 basis points over the year. In addition to international factors, there had been UK-specific considerations, including data news that had been taken by market participants to suggest risks of a weaker outlook for activity, which had also been partly reflected in a small depreciation in the sterling effective exchange rate. 5: Bank staff expected that GDP had fallen by 0.1% in 2024 Q4 and projected that it would rise by 0.1% in 2025 Q1. The Committee discussed the extent to which recent developments reflected underlying demand and supply drivers, acknowledging significant uncertainties around the current and prospective balance between them. The recent slowdown in demand was assumed to have led to only a small margin of slack opening up, as growth in the supply capacity of the economy appeared to have been weakening for some time. Within potential supply, potential productivity appeared to have been very weak while labour supply growth had been strong. Business survey indicators of output growth had deteriorated over recent months, as had broader metrics of business and consumer confidence, which would be consistent with a slowdown in demand, and the household savings rate had continued to be high. The ratio of broad money to nominal GDP had returned to close to its pre-Covid trend, suggesting an erosion of the money overhang that had emerged during the pandemic. 6: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen slightly, to 2.5% in December. The latest evidence from key indicators suggested progress on underlying disinflation in domestic prices and wages had generally continued. There had nevertheless been substantial upside news to the near-term outlook for headline CPI inflation, which was now expected to rise quite sharply in the near term, to 3.7% in 2025 Q3, owing in part to energy prices, before easing again. Measures of households’ short-term inflation expectations had increased somewhat over the previous few months, while businesses’ short-term inflation expectations had picked up slightly but had remained well below recent peaks. The immediate policy decision 7: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. 8: The Committee’s latest projection for CPI inflation was set out in the accompanying February Monetary Policy Report. In support of returning inflation sustainably to the 2% target, the Committee was maintaining its focus on the persistence of inflationary pressures in the medium term. Progress on disinflation in domestic prices and wages had generally continued. 9: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, CPI inflation had fallen slightly, while services inflation had moderated. Annual private sector regular AWE growth had increased, although the news from other pay indicators had been mixed. Pay growth was expected to slow to around 3¾% by year-end, broadly consistent with estimates from the Agents’ annual pay survey, as well as the Decision Maker Panel. GDP growth had been weaker than expected at the time of the November Report, and indicators of business and consumer confidence had declined. GDP growth was expected to pick up from the middle of this year. The labour market had continued to ease and was judged to be broadly in balance. Productivity growth had been weaker than previously estimated, and the Committee judged that growth in the supply capacity of the economy had weakened. 10: Reflecting recent developments in global energy costs and regulated prices, CPI inflation was expected to rise quite sharply in the near term, to 3.7%. The MPC judged that this would not lead to additional second-round effects on underlying domestic inflationary pressures. Compared with economic conditions during the succession of large external cost shocks in 2021-22, the labour market was now looser and therefore some of the dynamics observed previously were unlikely to reoccur. Nevertheless, given the recent extended period over which inflation had remained above the 2% target, the threshold for second-round effects might now be somewhat lower. 11: In the medium term, and conditioned on the market path for interest rates, inflation was expected to return to around the 2% target. The MPC’s February forecast remained consistent with the second case for the evolution of persistent inflationary pressures that the Committee had identified previously. That is, the emerging margin of slack in the economy was projected to act against some continuing second-round effects in domestic prices and wages, allowing CPI inflation to fall back to target sustainably. 12: Taking recent developments together, the Committee was now placing greater weight on the second and third cases that it had been considering. Nevertheless, there were considerable risks around the path of spare capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures over the medium term, to which monetary policy might need to respond. 13: In terms of upside risks, the continued elevated rate of wage growth, and the upside news in the near-term outlook for headline CPI, could present a risk to inflation persistence, particularly if it were to affect firms’ and households’ inflation expectations. 14: In terms of downside risks, domestic inflationary pressures could be weaker than projected in the forecast. In addition, recent developments in activity could reflect greater weakness in demand relative to supply, and UK and global uncertainties could weigh further on demand and the labour market. This could lower wage pressures and dampen companies’ pricing power going forward. 15: The MPC judged that monetary policy still remained clearly in restrictive territory, following recent reductions in Bank Rate. However, there was a range of views among members on the remaining degree of restrictiveness. 16: While cyclical developments in the economy played a significant role in determining the monetary stance at policy-relevant horizons, the long-term real equilibrium interest rate, R*, could also play a role in that assessment as a long-term anchor for the policy rate, albeit not as a direct guide for setting policy. As set out in Box A in the February Report, there was evidence that R* had risen modestly since the MPC's previous assessment in 2018, but there was significant uncertainty around the range of estimates at any point and the extent of any increase. 17: The Committee turned to the immediate policy decision. 18: Seven members preferred to reduce Bank Rate to 4.5% at this meeting, on the basis that there had continued to be sufficient progress on disinflation in domestic prices and wages. There was a range of views underlying these members’ outlooks for the economy, with various risks around both the domestic and global environment. 19: On one view, looking through the expected near-term pickup in CPI inflation, the disinflation process had remained on track, and weakening activity and a looser labour market could weigh further on inflation. There was increased uncertainty around both the UK and global economic outlooks, with potentially countervailing forces acting on the prospects for domestic inflation. This warranted an approach to policymaking which was both gradual in continuing to lean against the persistence in inflation and careful in recognising increased uncertainty and that there were two-sided risks to inflation. 20: On another view, the upside news in indicators of pay growth and inflation over recent quarters, in parallel with continued weakness in activity, was symptomatic of constrained supply relative to demand. In large part, this reflected tepid productivity growth, which was unlikely to recover significantly over the forecast period. On this basis, weakness in observed activity and employment going forward could continue to reflect constrained supply rather than an accumulation of economic slack. This view continued to warrant a cautious and gradual removal of monetary policy restriction. 21: Two members preferred a 0.5 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate, to 4.25%, although they had different views on inflation dynamics, the structural factors underpinning them, and future monetary policy. Disaggregated data pointed to inflation continuing to decline through both wage and price-setting channels. The prospect of weak activity and lower labour demand was likely to reduce wage pressures as well as moderate firms’ pricing power. For one member, a more activist approach at this meeting would give a clearer signal of financial conditions appropriate for the United Kingdom, even as monetary policy would need to remain restrictive for some time to anchor inflation expectations, and Bank Rate would likely stay high given structural persistence and macroeconomic volatility. For the other member, the subdued outlook for demand remained consistent with CPI inflation staying sustainably at the target in the medium term despite the expected near-term uptick in regulated prices, and Bank Rate needed to account for policy transmission and supply capacity over the medium term. 22: Based on the Committee’s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint was appropriate. 23: In addition to the risks around inflation persistence, there were also uncertainties around the trajectories of both demand and supply in the economy that could have implications for monetary policy. Should there be greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, this could push down on inflationary pressures, warranting a less restrictive path of Bank Rate. If there were to be more constrained supply relative to demand, this could sustain domestic price and wage pressures, consistent with a relatively tighter monetary policy path. 24: The Committee would continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evolving evidence might reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. 25: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.5%. 26: Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted in favour of the proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Catherine L Mann) voted against the proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 4.25%. Operational considerations 27: On 5 February, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was £646 billion. 28: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Clare Lombardelli Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Alan Taylor Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. David Roberts was also present on 27 January and 3 February, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target.

The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. At its meeting ending on 19 March 2025, the MPC voted by a majority of 8–1 to maintain Bank Rate at 4.5%. One member preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%. As the Committee noted in February, there has been substantial progress on disinflation over the past two years, as previous external shocks have receded, and as the restrictive stance of monetary policy has curbed second-round effects and stabilised longer-term inflation expectations. That progress has allowed the MPC to withdraw gradually some degree of policy restraint, while maintaining Bank Rate in restrictive territory so as to continue to squeeze out persistent inflationary pressures. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, global trade policy uncertainty has intensified, and the United States has made a range of tariff announcements, to which some governments have responded. Other geopolitical uncertainties have also increased and indicators of financial market volatility have risen globally. The German government has announced plans for significant reform to its fiscal rules. While UK GDP growth estimates have been slightly stronger than expected at the time of the February Monetary Policy Report, business survey indicators generally continue to suggest weakness in growth and particularly in employment intentions. In recent quarters, subdued activity has been judged to reflect both demand and supply factors. Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to 3.0% in January from 2.5% in December, slightly higher than expected in the February Report. Domestic price and wage pressures are moderating, but remain somewhat elevated. Although global energy prices have fallen back recently, they remain higher than last year and CPI inflation is still projected to rise to around 3¾% in 2025 Q3. While inflation is expected to fall back thereafter, the Committee will pay close attention to any consequent signs of more lasting inflationary pressures. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4.5%. Based on the Committee’s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint is appropriate. Should there be greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, this could push down on inflationary pressures, warranting a less restrictive path of Bank Rate. Should there be more constrained supply relative to demand and more persistence in domestic wages and prices, including from second-round effects related to the near-term increase in CPI inflation, this would warrant a relatively tighter monetary policy path. The Committee will continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence may reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 19 March 2025 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.5% in 2024 Q4, in line with the projection in the February Monetary Policy Report. Since the MPC’s February meeting, there had been a further increase in geopolitical and global trade policy uncertainty, and it was likely that this elevated uncertainty would persist. The US administration had imposed tariffs on some goods imports from some of its trading partners, as well as on all steel and aluminium imports, to which some governments had responded with tariffs of their own. 3: The Committee judged that the consequent risks around the near-term outlook for activity in a number of advanced economies, including the United Kingdom, remained to the downside. The overall effect on UK inflation was less clear at present, and would depend on where other countries’ trade policies settled and how these transmitted through different economic channels, including exchange rates. The Committee noted that this was a rapidly evolving situation, which it would monitor closely and assess further in the May policy round. 4: Euro-area GDP growth had remained subdued, increasing by 0.2% in 2024 Q4, marginally higher than the February Report projection. The S&P Global HCOB PMI composite output index had suggested a modest increase in activity at the start of the year. Looking ahead, the German government had announced plans for significant reform to its fiscal rules, including making way for sizeable increases in defence and infrastructure spending. 5: US GDP had increased by 0.6% in 2024 Q4, in line with the February Report projection. Going forward, growth was expected to slow on the back of tariff and wider policy uncertainty, among other factors. Indicators of activity for 2025 Q1 suggested a weakening in household consumption growth and consumer confidence, while some surveys of firms’ output and investment expectations had also fallen in February. 6: In China, GDP had grown by 1.6% in 2024 Q4, and the government had set an annual growth target of around 5% for 2025. Growth was expected to slow in Q1 as the impact of past policy stimulus was fading. The imposition of tariffs by the US posed a downside risk to activity this year, although this could be somewhat ameliorated by the further fiscal stimulus announced in March. 7: The euro-area labour market had remained somewhat tight but had continued to normalise, while the labour market in the United States had remained close to balance. Unemployment in these regions remained at or near historical lows, and indicators of pay growth had generally been cooling. 8: Annual headline consumer price inflation had decreased slightly in the euro area and the United States, owing largely to base effects. In the euro area, twelve-month HICP inflation had decreased to 2.3% in February, while core inflation had also fallen slightly to 2.6%. In the United States, PCE inflation had fallen slightly to 2.5% in January, and core PCE inflation had fallen to 2.6%. Services price inflation remained somewhat elevated in both economies. Some measures of short and medium-term household inflation expectations in the United States had risen, possibly reflecting the impact of anticipated tariffs. 9: Since the MPC’s February meeting, negotiations around a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, and the consequent possible prospect of a boost in global gas and oil supply, had contributed to declines in wholesale energy prices, although they had remained higher than last year. European wholesale near-term gas futures prices had fallen since the previous meeting by around 20%, with the potential relaxation of winter storage targets and a surge in liquefied natural gas imports also playing a role. Brent crude spot prices had fallen by 7%, to $71 per barrel, which was additionally reflective of the announced increased in OPEC+ supply from April, as well as weakening US economic activity and uncertainty around trade policies. Monetary and financial conditions 10: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, financial market volatility had risen globally, reflecting an intensification of geopolitical and trade policy uncertainty. 11: There had been contrasting financial market developments across jurisdictions since the February MPC meeting. In the United States, government bond yields were lower, the dollar had depreciated, and equity prices were notably lower, having fallen by around 10% over the past month. Market contacts had noted that these movements in part reflected the impact of policy uncertainty on the US economic growth outlook. In contrast, in the euro area, government bond yields had increased sharply, driven by significant news on more expansionary German fiscal policy. On 5 March, German ten-year government bond yields had risen by around 30 basis points, the largest one-day move in over 30 years. The euro exchange rate had appreciated and euro-area equity prices, while volatile, had risen on balance. 12: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, the market-implied path for policy rates had fallen in the United States and had risen in the euro area. Nonetheless, expected policy rates over the next three years remained materially higher in the United States than in the euro area. At its meeting on 6 March, the ECB Governing Council had announced a 25 basis point reduction in its deposit facility rate to 2.5%, in line with market expectations. At its meeting ending on 19 March, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee was expected to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, at 4.25% to 4.5%. 13: Overall, since the MPC’s previous meeting, financial market movements in the United Kingdom had been affected by global developments but had been smaller than in the United States and the euro area. Gilt yields had risen, there had been some appreciation in the sterling effective exchange rate and UK equity prices were on balance little changed. Market contacts continued to highlight two-sided risks to the UK macroeconomic outlook. The median respondent to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected CPI inflation to peak at around 3.5% in Q3 this year, an increase relative to expectations in the previous survey. Respondents continued to expect inflation to be at the 2% target at the three-year horizon. There had been little change in medium-term UK financial market inflation compensation measures. 14: Market expectations were for Bank Rate to remain unchanged at this meeting. Thereafter, the median MaPS respondent expected a further 75 basis points of Bank Rate cuts this year. Market contacts emphasised elevated economic uncertainty, with perceptions that the near-term distribution for Bank Rate was skewed towards fewer cuts. Consistent with that, the path for Bank Rate implied by market pricing was somewhat higher than for the median MaPS respondent, declining by a little over 50 basis points over the rest of the year. 15: Pass-through from the relevant risk-free reference rates to saving and borrowing rates facing households and corporates had remained broadly in line with historical experience. The main exception had been household sight deposit rates, which had fallen by less and more slowly than Bank Rate since August, although these rates had not risen by as much as Bank Rate during the recent tightening cycle. 16: The average rate paid on the stock of floating rate mortgages had fallen since Bank Rate was first cut in August last year, reflecting full pass through at a pace in line with previous experience. But the average rate paid on the stock of fixed rate mortgages had risen as the majority of fixed term mortgages refinanced at higher rates. Overall, that meant the average rate paid on the total stock of all outstanding mortgages had continued to rise, albeit at a decreasing rate. An increasing proportion of households were choosing to borrow over longer terms, which reduced monthly capital repayments in the near term but meant they would have more debt to service further out. 17: House prices and mortgage lending had continued to recover in recent months. Market contacts noted that part of that rise might reflect a bringing forward of house purchases ahead of increases to Stamp Duty Land Tax due to take effect from April. House purchase mortgage approvals had remained broadly flat since last August at relatively robust levels. 18: There had been a relatively large increase in aggregate sterling broad money in January, driven by the volatile Non-Intermediary Other Financial Companies sector as well as inflows into the household and private non-financial company sectors. Given the volatility in near-term money data, lower-frequency trends typically provided a more reliable cross-check on the outlook. The ratio of broad money to nominal GDP had continued to drift down to around its end-2019 level, and was slightly below the level implied by the extrapolation of its trend between 2012 and 2019. Demand and output 19: UK GDP had risen by 0.1% in 2024 Q4, above the -0.1% rate that had been expected in the February Monetary Policy Report. Quarterly growth had been supported by a 0.4% increase in monthly GDP in December. That in turn had been accounted for by a pickup in business-to-business services activity. The level of GDP had fallen back by 0.1% on the month in January, largely reflecting weakness in manufacturing output. 20: Reflecting the higher starting point to the level of 2025 Q1 GDP, Bank staff now expected around ¼% growth in 2025 Q1, higher than the 0.1% that had been incorporated in the February Report. This nowcast was, however, somewhat stronger than the combined steer from business surveys, of 0.0 to 0.1%, that was probably more representative of the underlying rate of growth. The S&P Global UK composite PMI output index had stabilised at just over 50 in recent months, although recent CBI output series had been somewhat weaker. The Bank’s Agents had reported that activity remained subdued, with weak consumer and business sentiment perceived as the main barrier to growth. 21: The Committee discussed the broader narrative behind recent weakness in activity. Official GDP data had been volatile over the past couple of years, but a slowing in growth was apparent on both headline GDP and other indicator-based underlying metrics towards the end of last year. As the Committee had considered in detail at its previous meeting, this was likely to reflect both weaker supply and a shortfall of demand relative to that weaker supply. Economic uncertainties, both globally and domestically, had risen recently. The data also suggested that monetary policy was continuing to weigh on activity, with slower growth in those industries that were more sensitive to interest rates. Intelligence from both the Decision Maker Panel survey and the Agents had pointed to a number of additional factors, including employment costs and global uncertainties, that continued to restrain firms’ investment decisions. The household saving ratio had remained elevated. 22: The Chancellor would announce the Spring Statement on 26 March, alongside an updated economic and fiscal forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Supply, costs and prices 23: Quality issues with the official labour market data continued to be an area of concern for the MPC. Low achieved sample sizes and very low response rates meant that Labour Force Survey (LFS)-based estimates of labour market dynamics remained subject to considerable uncertainties, which increased the challenge of gauging the underlying state of labour market activity. The MPC had, for some time, utilised a wide range of information beyond official data to inform its judgements on the labour market, including business surveys and intelligence from the Bank’s Agents. 24: A range of early-stage and more timely indicators of labour market dynamics, typically those reflecting labour demand and firms’ hiring decisions, had weakened in recent months to varying degrees. Some indicators, such as the S&P Global UK PMI composite employment and REC Report on Jobs permanent staff placements indices, had deteriorated markedly to levels consistent with shrinking employment. Other indicators had not weakened to the same extent. The volume of vacancies over recent months had been broadly flat at similar levels to 2019 Q4. The three-month rolling average of HMRC payroll estimates of inflows to employee jobs had remained below its level in early 2024, whereas estimates of outflows had been relatively stable over the same period. 25: The overall weakening in these early-stage indicators suggested that some modest deterioration in late-stage indicators, such as redundancy and unemployment rates, should be expected over the coming months. The latest intelligence from the Agents suggested that employment intentions had weakened, on balance, and more firms had reported hiring pauses or freezes. These contacts had said that they would review staffing levels through natural attrition or redundancies if the outlook did not improve. The rolling three-month average of HR1 redundancy notifications, a leading indicator of actual redundancies, had remained, on average, at its historical norm in recent months. 26: Measures of labour market tightness had continued to ease slightly. The vacancies to unemployment ratio had remained around Bank staff’s estimate of its equilibrium level. The latest intelligence from the Agents’ contacts suggested that recruitment difficulties had normalised. Such developments pointed to a labour market that was broadly in balance. 27: The LFS estimate of employment growth in the three months to January had been stronger than expected in the February Monetary Policy Report. The collective steer from business surveys, HMRC payroll data and the Agents’ employment intention scores pointed to underlying quarterly employment growth of 0.1% in 2025 Q1, broadly consistent with expectations at the time of the February Report. This was below population growth of around ¼%. 28: A broad set of indicators suggested that underlying pay growth had eased further in recent months, albeit to a still elevated level and above what could be explained by economic fundamentals. This softening in underlying pay growth contrasted with annual growth in private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE), which had picked up to 6.1% in the three months to January from 4.9% in the three months to September. Bank staff analysis suggested that compositional effects, reflecting changes in the sectoral and full-time mix of employees, had accounted for only some of this increase in AWE growth. It also appeared that some sectors with historically volatile pay growth had accounted for the increase in AWE growth in 2024 Q4. Downweighting these volatile sectors brought the AWE measure more into line with Bank staff’s estimate of underlying pay growth. 29: The MPC noted that in February the ONS had announced that in a forthcoming release it would open up revisions to the AWE data over a longer back run than the usual revision to the preceding month’s estimate, to allow for late and updated returns from one business to be included. 30: The latest pay settlements and pay expectations data had been consistent with the February Report projection for pay growth to ease over the course of this year. Data from the Bank’s and Brightmine’s settlements databases suggested that the median rate of pay awards had remained at around 3 to 4% in the three months to February, although these estimates had been based on relatively small sample sizes. The latest intelligence from the Agents suggested average pay rises for 2025 of 3.5% to 4%, consistent with the average of 3.7% reported in the Agents’ annual pay survey conducted ahead of the February Report. The latest Decision Maker Panel (DMP) survey had reported that businesses’ pay growth expectations for the year ahead had remained at 3.9% in the three months to February. The MPC continued to monitor closely the flow of pay settlements information and other data that would provide signals for the future path of pay growth. 31: Twelve-month CPI inflation had increased to 3.0% in January from 2.5% in December. This was slightly higher than had been forecast at the time of the February Report, reflecting upside news to core goods and food prices. Core CPI inflation had also increased, to 3.7%, in line with expectations at the time of the February Report. 32: Core consumer goods price inflation had risen to 1.6% in January, alongside a material increase in food consumer price inflation, to 3.3%. Alongside external shocks, it was possible that domestic factors, such as labour costs, had been a driver of the recent pickup in core consumer goods and food prices. Additionally, the Agents had reported that some of their contacts had passed on costs associated with the Extended Producer Responsibility for packaging regulations, which were due to be finalised in July. The Agents’ contacts had indicated that there could be additional pass-through from these costs in the second half of this year. In addition, there had been some pockets of strength in certain commodity prices, such as cocoa and coffee, which appeared to have had a significant impact on food inflation. 33: Services price inflation had risen from 4.4% in December to 5.0% in January. This increase was, however, somewhat weaker than had been expected at the time of the February Report. Underlying services price inflation had remained elevated across a broad range of measures, regardless of whether they were based on exclusionary, trimming or reweighting approaches. While these had been on a downward trajectory through 2024, there had been little change in annual underlying services price inflation between December and January. Measures of underlying services inflation would probably reflect some of the pass-through from the forthcoming increase in employers National Insurance contributions, requiring some caution in their interpretation over coming months. 34: CPI inflation was expected to rise further in the near term, to around 3¾% in 2025 Q3. This expectation was little changed from the projection made at the time of the February Report. Upside news to non-energy consumer goods prices had been offset by downside news to energy prices from downward moves in sterling oil and gas price curves relative to the assumptions in the February Report projection. 35: Indicators of households’ short- and medium-term inflation expectations had continued to rise in the latest data. The Citi/YouGov measure of median one-year ahead inflation expectations had risen to 3.9% in February, while the Bank/Ipsos measure had risen to 3.4%. This compared to pre-pandemic averages of 2.5% and 3.0% respectively. These increases could be broadly explained by households responding to actual inflation and in particular salient prices, such as food and energy, but they nevertheless represented an upside risk to future pay and inflation dynamics. Medium-term measures from these surveys had risen to similar levels and these had been a little above what could be explained by observed moves in the equivalent short-term measures. 36: Businesses’ inflation expectations had also risen, with the DMP reporting that businesses’ own price year-ahead inflation expectations had increased by 0.5 percentage points over the past six months, to 4.0% in the three months to February. This had left firms’ own-price inflation expectations marginally higher than own-price inflation realisations, which suggested firms no longer expected their own-price inflation rate to fall over the year ahead. The latest Consensus Economics survey of professional forecasters had reported an increase in the peak of the mean UK inflation forecast, to 3.7% in September 2025 up from 3.2% in the February survey. The immediate policy decision 37: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. 38: Since the MPC’s previous meeting, global trade policy uncertainty had intensified, and the United States had made a range of tariff announcements, to which some governments had responded. Other geopolitical uncertainties had also increased and indicators of financial market volatility had risen globally. The German government had announced plans for significant reform to its fiscal rules. The MPC would continue to assess global developments closely. 39: The Committee considered domestic economic developments and how these informed the assessment that progress on disinflation was continuing. The news since the previous MPC meeting had been mixed and, taken together, broadly in line with expectations at the time of the February Monetary Policy Report. 40: The Committee stressed the importance for policy making of high quality and reliable official data across the full range of economic and labour market statistics. 41: While UK GDP growth estimates had been slightly stronger than expected at the time of the February Report, business survey indicators generally continued to suggest weakness in growth. In recent quarters, subdued activity had been judged to reflect both demand and supply factors. 42: The labour market had continued to ease, although it was still judged to be broadly in balance. Some indicators of employment intentions had deteriorated markedly, to levels consistent with shrinking employment. Other indicators, such as the number of vacancies, had not weakened to the same extent. The Committee was continuing to monitor the response of employers to increases in their costs and to the subdued level of activity. 43: Twelve-month CPI inflation had increased to 3.0% in January from 2.5% in December, slightly higher than had been expected in the February Report. This had reflected upside news in core consumer goods and food prices, which had more than offset slight downside news in services prices. Alongside external shocks, it was possible that domestic factors, such as labour costs, had been a driver of the recent pickup in non-energy goods prices. 44: Domestic price and wage pressures were moderating, but remained somewhat elevated. A broad range of measures had pointed to little change in underlying annual services price inflation between December and January. A range of indicators suggested that underlying pay growth had eased further in recent months, although annual growth in private sector regular average weekly earnings had picked up to 6.1% in the three months to January. 45: The latest wage settlements and pay expectations data had continued to suggest an easing in pay growth over the course of this year. The Committee would be monitoring incoming settlements data closely as they became available on a more comprehensive basis later in the year. More generally, the future trajectory of pay growth, relative to the likely path of productivity growth in the economy, would be an important determinant of the Committee’s views on the persistence of domestic inflationary pressures. 46: Household inflation expectations had risen in recent months, at both short and medium-term horizons. Businesses’ inflation expectations had also risen, with the Decision Maker Panel survey reporting that businesses’ own price year-ahead inflation expectations had increased over the past six months. There had been little change in medium-term UK financial market inflation compensation measures. 47: Although global energy prices had fallen back recently, they remained higher than last year and CPI inflation was still projected to rise to around 3¾% in 2025 Q3. While inflation was expected to fall back thereafter, the Committee would pay close attention to any consequent signs of more lasting inflationary pressures. Monetary policy would act to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target. 48: Since last summer, and as set out in Box A in the November Report, the Committee’s policy deliberations had been supported by the consideration of three cases that could affect the evolution of inflation persistence. These cases had focused on the uncertainties around domestic price and wage-setting behaviour, as the succession of very large external cost shocks in 2021–22 unwound and as headline CPI inflation returned close to the 2% target last year. These cases would change as the economy evolved and new shocks emerged. 49: Ahead of the May Report, the Committee was likely to consider scenarios for the risks around medium-term inflation, building on its recent deliberations. The MPC was currently focused on two particular risks. First, the extent to which there could be greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply in the economy, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically, which could push down on inflationary pressures in the medium term. Second, the extent to which there could be more persistence in domestic wage and prices, both from more constrained supply relative to demand and from additional second-round effects related to the projected near-term increase in CPI inflation. The MPC would review the evidence on the impact and likelihood of these broad risks as a part of its May policy round, alongside its baseline forecast. 50: At this meeting, eight members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.5%. The Committee had noted in February that progress on disinflation in domestic prices and wages had generally continued. There had been relatively little news since the previous meeting from UK economic developments, notwithstanding the intensification in global uncertainties, and there continued to be a range of views underlying these members’ outlooks for the economy and inflation. There remained two-sided risks around the balance of supply and demand, and the persistence of domestic price and wage pressures. The underlying disinflationary process was expected to continue, but an accumulation of evidence would be used to assess progress. There was no presumption that monetary policy was on a pre-set path over the next few meetings. 51: One member preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate, to 4.25%. While global price developments had continued to pose risks for some time, disaggregated data pointed to inflation continuing to decline through both wage and price-setting channels. The earlier concerns of an asymmetry in the inflation process on the way down compared to the way up had not materialised, as goods disinflation had generally been passed through to consumers. The subdued outlook for demand remained consistent with services inflation normalising sustainably to target over the medium term. The setting of Bank Rate needed to account for policy transmission and the risks to supply capacity from a prolonged period of monetary restrictiveness. 52: Based on the Committee’s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint was appropriate. Should there be greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, this could push down on inflationary pressures, warranting a less restrictive path of Bank Rate. Should there be more constrained supply relative to demand and more persistence in domestic wages and prices, including from second-round effects related to the near-term increase in CPI inflation, this would warrant a relatively tighter monetary policy path. 53: The Committee would continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence might reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. 54: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 4.5%. 55: Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted in favour of the proposition. Swati Dhingra voted against the proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%. Operational considerations 56: On 19 March, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was £623 billion. 57: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Clare Lombardelli Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Alan Taylor Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target.

The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. At its meeting ending on 7 May 2025, the MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%. Two members preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 4%. Two members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.5%. There has been substantial progress on disinflation over the past two years, as previous external shocks have receded, and as the restrictive stance of monetary policy has curbed second-round effects and stabilised longer-term inflation expectations. That progress has allowed the MPC to withdraw gradually some degree of policy restraint, while maintaining Bank Rate in restrictive territory so as to continue to squeeze out persistent inflationary pressures. Underlying UK GDP growth is judged to have slowed since the middle of 2024, and the labour market has continued to loosen. Progress on disinflation in domestic price and wage pressures is generally continuing. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March from 2.8% in February, close to expectations in the February Monetary Policy Report. Although indicators of pay growth remain elevated, a significant slowing is still expected over the rest of the year. Wholesale energy prices have fallen back since the February Report. Previous increases in energy prices are still likely to drive up CPI inflation from April onwards, to 3.5% for 2025 Q3. Inflation is expected to fall back thereafter. Measures of household inflation expectations have risen recently. Uncertainty surrounding global trade policies has intensified since the imposition of tariffs by the United States and the measures taken in response by some of its trading partners. There has subsequently been volatility in financial markets, and market-implied policy rates have moved lower. Prospects for global growth have weakened as a result of this uncertainty and new tariff announcements, although the negative impacts on UK growth and inflation are likely to be smaller. The Committee remains focused on returning CPI inflation sustainably to target in the medium term. In deciding the appropriate degree and pace of monetary policy adjustments required to achieve this, the Committee has considered a range of possibilities for how domestic inflationary pressures could evolve, as well as the broader circumstances that could necessitate varying the course of policy. The May Report sets out two illustrative scenarios. In one scenario, there could be weaker supply and more persistence in domestic wages and prices, including from second-round effects related to the near-term increase in CPI inflation. In another scenario, inflationary pressures could ease more quickly owing to greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically. Monetary policy is not on a pre-set path. The Committee will remain sensitive to heightened unpredictability in the economic environment and will continue to update its assessment of risks. At this meeting, the Committee voted to reduce Bank Rate to 4.25%, reflecting continued progress in disinflation though with risks to inflation remaining in both directions. Based on the Committee’s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remains appropriate. The Committee will continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence may reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 7 May 2025 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying May 2025 Monetary Policy Report . 2: The Committee discussed recent global economic developments, and in particular the likely impact on the outlook for UK inflation of the various changes to trade tariffs that had recently been announced by the United States and some of its trading partners. These potential impacts were discussed in more detail in Box C of the May Report. 3: These trade policy developments were likely to reduce UK activity, and to create further risks to the downside. The impact on UK inflation was more ambiguous at this stage. The baseline expectation was that these developments would push down slightly on inflation over the forecast period. There were material risks on both sides around this judgement, however, including from: weaker global demand; the degree of diversion of exports to non-US markets; how closely the pass-through from global export prices to domestic consumer prices matched previous experience; the level of disruption to supply chains; the extent of further tariff policy announcements; and the risk of broader fragmentation of the global economy and financial system. The Committee would monitor the relevant indicators closely, and would continue to use multiple analytical approaches to evaluate the impact of these developments. 4: Financial markets had been volatile globally following the trade policy announcements in early April, as set out in the May Report. Almost all respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) were expecting a 25 basis point reduction in Bank Rate at this MPC meeting, in line with market pricing. Since the MPC's previous meeting the median MaPS respondent expected 75 basis points of further Bank Rate cuts this year, although the overall distribution was now skewed towards more cuts. This was consistent with the market-implied path declining by just under 100 basis points over the rest of the year. 5: The Committee discussed the extent to which movements in UK markets had reflected international factors. International considerations had clearly been the most prominent influence during this period, although, given the US-specific nature of the tariff policy announcements, it was not surprising that the previously close relation between US and UK markets had weakened appreciably in recent weeks. MaPS respondents reported that international factors had generally pushed down on the prospects for activity and inflation, and therefore on near-term UK policy rate expectations, partly offset by the upward impact of domestic factors on inflation. 6: Monthly GDP growth in February had been much stronger than expected, at 0.5%, and Bank staff now estimated that headline GDP growth in 2025 Q1 had been 0.6%. But this news had been accounted for largely by erratic factors, for instance those that had affected output in the manufacturing sector. Bank staff estimated that underlying growth in Q1 had been around zero. Headline GDP growth was projected to slow sharply in Q2, to 0.1%, with risks to the downside, given the signal from high-frequency data. The S&P Global UK composite output PMI had fallen sharply in April, although it remained unclear how much of this decline stemmed from a potentially reversible deterioration in business sentiment. 7: The Committee discussed the extent to which developments in activity had reflected underlying demand and supply drivers, acknowledging that both were likely to have played a role. In the baseline forecast, a margin of slack was expected to continue to open up over the coming years, sufficient to remove remaining excess inflation persistence. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate, monetary policy was expected to continue to restrain aggregate demand, while fiscal consolidation was expected to play a greater role in the latter part of the forecast. Potential productivity growth was also expected to pick up. The balance of risks around the baseline forecast for GDP growth was judged to be somewhat to the downside. 8: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 2.6% in March. The latest evidence from key indicators suggested that progress on underlying disinflation in domestic prices and wages had generally continued, supported by the restrictiveness of monetary policy. 9: The Committee discussed the outlook for a range of nominal indicators. Private sector regular pay growth was expected to slow significantly further by the end of 2025, to around 3¾%, consistent with the latest indications from the Bank’s Agents’ contacts, and from the DMP Survey. That said, survey measures of household inflation expectations had risen further in recent months, perhaps suggesting that households had become more sensitive to inflationary pressures, having recently experienced very high rates of inflation in 2022. Businesses’ medium-term CPI inflation expectations had increased slightly recently, although indicators of medium-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets had generally continued to trend downwards. 10: CPI inflation was expected to rise to a peak of 3.5% on average in 2025 Q3, in large part reflecting developments in household energy bills and, to a lesser degree, regulated prices. This projected increase in headline inflation was still expected to be temporary. The Committee recognised the risk that this projected increase in headline inflation, along with the current trajectory of household inflation expectations, might pose additional risks to persistence if non-linearities were to emerge beyond specific inflation thresholds. The immediate policy decision 11: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. 12: Underlying UK GDP growth was judged to have slowed since the middle of 2024, and the labour market had continued to loosen. 13: Progress on disinflation in domestic price and wage pressures had generally continued. Twelve-month CPI inflation was 2.6% in March, close to expectations in the February Monetary Policy Report. Although indicators of pay growth had remained elevated, a significant slowing was still expected over the rest of the year. Wholesale energy prices had fallen back since the February Report. Previous increases in energy prices were still likely to drive up CPI inflation from April onwards, to 3.5% on average in 2025 Q3. Inflation was expected to fall back thereafter. 14: Uncertainty surrounding global trade policies had intensified since the imposition of tariffs by the United States and the measures taken in response by some of its trading partners. There had subsequently been volatility in financial markets, and market-implied policy rates had moved lower. Prospects for global growth had weakened as a result of this uncertainty and new tariff announcements, although the negative impacts on UK growth and inflation were likely to be smaller. 15: The Committee remained focused on returning inflation sustainably to the target. In the baseline forecast set out in the May Monetary Policy Report, inflation was expected to return to around the 2% target in the medium term. Overall, the Committee judged that the risks around GDP growth in the baseline forecast were somewhat to the downside, while the risks around the CPI projection were two-sided. 16: In reaching its judgement, and against a backdrop of increased uncertainty, the Committee had been assessing a wide range of risks around the baseline forecast, from both domestic and global factors. The May Monetary Policy Report set out two illustrative scenarios from a much broader set of plausible paths the economy could take. These were intended to explore different economic mechanisms, to which members attached different weights. 17: In the first scenario, greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically, might further mitigate inflationary pressures over the medium term. Underlying GDP growth had been weak, and global trade policy uncertainty had risen sharply, which was likely to weigh on household consumption and business investment. It was possible in this environment of uncertainty that precautionary saving could rise and consumption could weaken. 18: In the second scenario, greater persistence in domestic wage- and price-setting, both from additional second-round effects related to the near-term increase in headline CPI inflation and from weaker aggregate supply, might exacerbate the persistence of inflation. Underlying services consumer price inflation and indicators of wage growth had been moderating, but remained at elevated levels. There was evidence that the near-term inflation expectations of firms and households had recently become more reactive to changes in current CPI inflation than they had been pre-Covid. In addition, there were upside risks to inflation stemming from softer growth in potential productivity. 19: More broadly, there were growing risks from potential global trade arrangements. Depending on how trade policies unfolded, UK inflation could be affected by a wide range of factors such as shifts in trade patterns, supply chain disruptions in the UK and abroad, and movements in global exchange rates. It was possible that the ultimate net effect of these developments could be materially more disinflationary for the UK than in the baseline forecast, but it was also possible that the effect could be slightly inflationary in the longer term. Overall, it was too early to conclude over what period and to what degree different economic effects could materialise. 20: All members stressed that monetary policy was not on a pre-set path. The Committee would remain sensitive to heightened unpredictability in the economic environment and would continue to update its assessment of risks. 21: At this meeting, five members voted to reduce Bank Rate to 4.25%. Prior to the latest global developments, most members in this group had judged that this policy decision would be finely balanced between no change in Bank Rate and a further reduction. Although the current impact of the global trade news should not be overstated, the news was sufficient for those members to judge that a reduction in Bank Rate was warranted. This level of Bank Rate would still leave the stance of monetary policy sufficiently restrictive to bear down on inflationary pressures, were they to re-intensify. For the other members in this group, even in the absence of the latest global news, the case for a reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting had been fairly clear. Underlying domestic disinflation was progressing as expected and monetary policy restrictiveness was bearing down on activity. 22: Two members preferred a 0.5 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting based on the outlook. The most significant contributions to the expected pickup in inflation would come from one-off tax and administered prices and past energy shocks. Incoming wage settlements had so far been close to the Agents’ annual pay survey figure for the end of 2025, and were approaching sustainable rates, while consumer spending remained weak and investment subdued. Along with domestic demand shifts and emerging slack, recent global developments in energy and trade policy pointed to potential downward risks to global growth and world export prices. In the medium term, a continued monetary policy stance that was too restrictive risked inflation deviating from the 2% target on a sustained basis and the opening up of an unduly large output gap. Given this balance of risks, a less restrictive policy path was warranted. 23: Two members preferred to hold Bank Rate at 4.5%, recognising that short-end market interest rates had already eased by around 40 basis points since the MPC’s previous meeting. For these members, the labour market was proving more resilient than expected, business surveys signalled continued inflationary pressures, and household expectations of inflation had firmed. All these indicators pointed to continued inflation persistence owing in part to structural rigidities on the supply side of the economy. Holding Bank Rate unchanged at this meeting would ensure that monetary policy remained sufficiently restrictive to weigh against stubborn inflationary pressures. 24: Based on the Committee’s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remained appropriate. The Committee would continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence may reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. 25: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%. 26: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Four members voted against the proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor) preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 4%. Two members (Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) preferred to leave Bank Rate unchanged, at 4.5%. Operational considerations 27: On 7 May, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was £620 billion. The MPC had been briefed on the amended operational arrangements for gilt sales in 2025 Q2, ahead of their publication in a Market Notice on 10 April. 28: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Clare Lombardelli Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Alan Taylor Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. David Roberts was also present on 29 April and 2 May, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors.

The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. At its meeting ending on 18 June 2025, the MPC voted by a majority of 6–3 to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%. Three members preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%. There has been substantial disinflation over the past two years, as previous external shocks have receded, and as the restrictive stance of monetary policy has curbed second-round effects and stabilised longer-term inflation expectations. This has allowed the MPC to withdraw gradually some degree of policy restraint, while maintaining Bank Rate in restrictive territory so as to continue to squeeze out existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures. Underlying UK GDP growth appears to have remained weak, and the labour market has continued to loosen, leading to clearer signs that a margin of slack has opened up over time. Measures of pay growth have continued to moderate and, as in May, the Committee expects a significant slowing over the rest of the year. The Committee remains vigilant about the extent to which easing pay pressures will feed through to consumer price inflation. Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to 3.4% in May from 2.6% in March, in line with expectations in the May Monetary Policy Report. The rise was largely due to a range of regulated prices and previous increases in energy prices. Consumer price inflation is expected to remain broadly at current rates throughout the remainder of the year before falling back towards target next year. Furthermore, global uncertainty remains elevated. Energy prices have risen owing to an escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. The Committee will remain sensitive to heightened unpredictability in the economic and geopolitical environment, and will continue to update its assessment of risks to the economy. There remain two-sided risks to inflation. Given the outlook, and continued disinflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remains appropriate. Monetary policy is not on a pre-set path. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%.

The international economy 2: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.4% in 2025 Q1, in line with the projection in the May Monetary Policy Report. Since the MPC’s May meeting, the US administration had made progress in negotiating trade deals with the United Kingdom and China. The reduction in tariffs with China had reduced the US average effective tariff rate by just over a third. However, the future configuration of tariffs remained highly uncertain, with potential changes in tariff policy continuing to pose risks to global trade. Indices of trade policy uncertainty had also remained at elevated levels. 3: The impact of trade policies had been evident in activity data. For example, GDP and trade releases suggested that exports to the United States had been expedited ahead of tariffs taking effect. On the one hand, euro-area GDP had grown by a stronger-than-expected 0.6% in 2025 Q1, accounted for by strong exports and investment, and GDP in China had expanded by 1.2%, supported by net exports. On the other hand, US GDP had contracted by 0.1%, weaker than had been anticipated, as imports had significantly outstripped exports. There had also been some tentative evidence over recent months that goods from China destined for the United States were being shipped to other countries, including to Asia and Europe. 4: More timely PMI data had suggested some further front-loading of activity in the euro area with strong manufacturing PMIs but softer services PMIs in May, although front-loading was expected to unwind over the second quarter as a whole. In the United States, consumer confidence and investment intentions indicators had rebounded in May, although ISM manufacturing PMIs had been softer. The US House of Representatives had passed a fiscal bill with significant tax cuts. These were broadly in line with what had been incorporated in the May Report forecast. The bill had yet to be passed by the Senate. 5: The euro-area labour market had remained tight but had continued to gradually normalise, while the labour market in the United States had remained close to balance. Unemployment in these regions had remained low compared to historic averages. Indicators of pay growth had continued to moderate. 6: Annual headline consumer price inflation had continued to decrease in the euro area and in the United States. In the euro area, there was growing evidence that the 2021-2022 inflationary shock had been largely squeezed out of the system. Twelve-month HICP inflation had decreased to 1.9% in May, marginally below what had been expected in the May Report, while core inflation had also fallen to 2.3%. Lower services price inflation had accounted for the decrease in the headline figure. In the United States, CPI inflation had risen slightly to 2.4% in May, and core inflation had remained at 2.8%. There were few signs of tariffs impacting the latest US inflation data but some measures of short and medium-term household inflation expectations had continued to rise, possibly reflecting the anticipated impact of tariffs. 7: The Committee discussed cross-country trends in inflation. Both wage growth and consumer services price inflation had remained at more elevated levels in the United Kingdom than in the euro area or the United States. While in part reflecting greater persistence of inflation in the United Kingdom, for services, some of that difference could be accounted for by the greater contribution of regulated prices to UK inflation recently. Any such comparisons also needed to take account of differences in cyclical and structural factors. 8: The Brent oil spot price had increased by 26% to $79 per barrel since the MPC’s May meeting, in part reflecting an escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran. European natural gas spot prices had also increased by 11%. Non-oil commodities prices were little changed. Monetary and financial conditions 9: Some measures of global financial market volatility had fallen back since the MPC’s previous meeting, although they had remained elevated overall in light of continuing geopolitical and trade policy uncertainty. Across advanced economies, government bond yields had been little changed overall. At the short end of the curve, yields had initially risen following the May MPC meeting, accounted for partly by an easing in tariffs between the United States and China, although they had subsequently fallen back following data releases. At the long end of the curve, initial increases had been associated with an increase in term premia related to the fiscal outlook in a number of economies, before those yields had also fallen back. 10: Equity prices had recovered in these economies since their declines following the US administration’s tariff announcement in April. The US dollar effective exchange rate had depreciated further and was around 5% weaker than its level prior to the April tariff announcement, with some investors diversifying into, or hedging dollar exposures using, other currencies. This had contributed to the relative strength in the euro effective exchange rate. 11: At its meeting on 5 June, the ECB Governing Council had announced a 25 basis point reduction in its interest rates, in line with market expectations. At its May meeting, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee had maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25 to 4.5%. 12: Consistent with moves in other advanced economies, gilt yields had initially risen and then fallen back, while UK equity prices were slightly higher since the MPC’s previous meeting. There had been a small appreciation in the sterling effective exchange rate. In the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS), the median profile for CPI inflation implied a peak of 3.4% in the third quarter of this year, a slight increase relative to expectations in the previous survey. The median respondent had continued to expect inflation to be at the 2% target at the three-year horizon. There had been little change in medium-term UK financial market inflation compensation measures. 13: Market expectations were for Bank Rate to remain unchanged at this meeting. The median MaPS respondent was expecting 50 basis points of Bank Rate cuts this year, unchanged from the May survey and broadly in line with what was implied by market pricing. The distribution of Bank Rate expectations had shifted upwards relative to the May survey, consistent with the relatively shallower profile of cuts implied by market pricing, albeit with market contacts continuing to emphasise ongoing economic uncertainty. 14: Underlying trends in money and credit data had been consistent with the assessment set out in the May Monetary Policy Report, though with some recent and temporary volatility associated with the bringing forward of house purchases ahead of increases in the Stamp Duty Land Tax that had come into effect in April. Given market-implied expectations for a shallower profile of Bank Rate since the MPC's previous meeting, quoted rates on some mortgage rates had increased slightly, consistent with a pace of pass-through in line with historical experience. Demand and output 15: UK GDP had increased by 0.7% in 2025 Q1, a little stronger than had been expected in the May Monetary Policy Report. Household consumption had risen by 0.2%, while business investment had increased by 5.9% following a weak 2024 Q4 outturn. Net trade excluding valuables was estimated to have made a positive contribution to quarterly growth, of 0.6 percentage points, while the change in inventories had contributed 0.2 percentage points to growth. Both of these components of GDP could have been affected by a front-loading of activity ahead of the imposition of new tariffs by the United States and related trade policy developments. 16: Monthly GDP had fallen by 0.3% in April, following fairly strong increases over previous months. The latest data appeared to have been affected by the front-loading of activity ahead of the increases in Stamp Duty Land Tax and in Vehicle Excise Duty in April. There had also been some evidence that the temporary boost to trade ahead of the imposition of new tariffs had unwound, with goods exports to the United States recording their largest ever monthly fall in April. Overall, the monthly path of output suggested that quarterly GDP growth was likely to fall back to around ¼% in 2025 Q2, slightly higher than had been expected at the time of the May Report. 17: Business surveys had continued to point to weak underlying GDP growth. For example, although the S&P Global UK composite PMI output index had risen to above 50 in May, it had remained some way below its historical average. Textual analysis of PMI responses by Bank staff suggested that global concerns had played a larger role in its weakness over recent months, relative to domestic factors. That said, most companies responding to the latest DMP Survey were not expecting tariffs to have a material impact on their sales and investment, and had judged that uncertainty around US tariffs fell between April and May. Agents’ intelligence suggested that business sentiment had continued to wane, with contacts not expecting to see a material recovery in demand until 2026. Taken together, the steer from surveys over recent months had remained consistent with a zero to slightly positive pace of underlying growth currently. 18: The Committee discussed the divergent signals on the strength of activity over recent months. Surveys had historically tended to give a less volatile steer on GDP growth, but they could also be affected excessively by swings in sentiment that were not ultimately reflected in firms’ output. Recent developments in output also needed to be considered in the wider context of the supply side of the economy, and the opening up of slack in the labour market and within companies. The Committee was continuing to monitor indicators of UK economic uncertainty and its impact on investment decisions. 19: Spending Review 2025 had agreed departmental settlements within the envelope for total government spending that had been confirmed at the Spring Statement in March. Budgets had now been set until 2028‑29 for day-to-day resource spending and until 2029-30 for capital spending. Supply, costs and prices 20: Issues with the quality of the official data, including relating to the labour market, continued to be an area of concern for the MPC. The Committee therefore continued to draw on a wide range of information beyond the official data to inform its judgements on the conjuncture. These sources included business surveys and intelligence from the Bank’s Agents. 21: Several indicators of labour demand and firms’ hiring intentions had softened further in recent months. The ONS/HMRC PAYE estimate of payrolled employees had fallen by 0.4% in the three months to May, with a single-month decline of 109,000 in May that had been the largest monthly contraction since May 2020. Revisions to early vintages of the HMRC data could be large and, given the earlier timing of the data extraction for May, the latest HMRC data were more uncertain than usual. That said, survey-based measures of the labour market, such as the employment component of the S&P Global UK composite PMI, the permanent staff placements component of the KPMG/REC Report on Jobs and the latest Agents’ intelligence on recruitment difficulties, corroborated this pattern of ongoing loosening. A measure of underlying employment growth developed by Bank staff continued to suggest a subdued rate of near-zero employment growth. 22: The ratio of vacancies to unemployment had continued to fall below Bank staff’s estimate of its equilibrium level. The net additional hours desired by workers, as a percentage of average hours worked, had risen to its highest level since March 2015 in 2025 Q1. The overall weakening in these early-stage indicators of the tightness of the labour market suggested that some modest deterioration in late-stage indicators, such as the unemployment rate and the redundancy rate, should be expected over the coming months. Churn in the labour market had remained subdued, with outflows from unemployment gradually edging lower. Taken together, the analysis conducted by Bank staff implied that slack was continuing to emerge in the labour market but there were no strong signs, as yet, that a more abrupt loosening was underway. 23: A broad set of indicators suggested that underlying pay growth had eased further in recent months, albeit to a still elevated level and above what could be explained by economic fundamentals. Private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE) growth had fallen to 5.1% in the three months to April, down from 5.5% in March. Annual pay growth in retail and hospitality had been 6.7% in April, in line with the increase in the National Living Wage. Higher-frequency estimates of AWE growth continued to indicate an annualised run-rate of around 5%. The timelier ONS/HMRC PAYE proxy for private sector pay had edged lower from 5.8% in April to 5.7% in May. 24: The latest data on pay settlements and pay expectations had remained on track with the May Monetary Policy Report projection for a significant decline in wage growth. Data from the Bank of England’s and Brightmine’s settlements databases suggested that the median rate of pay awards had remained at around 3 to 4% since the start of the year, although these estimates had continued to be based on incomplete samples. The latest intelligence from the Agents had continued to suggest average pay settlements for 2025 of 3.5 to 4%, consistent with the range reported in the Agents’ annual pay survey that had been conducted ahead of the February Report. The MPC continued to monitor closely the flow of pay settlements information and other data that would enhance the Committee’s visibility on the prospective path of pay growth. 25: Twelve-month CPI inflation had been 3.4% in May, following 2.6% in March and 3.5% in April. The rise since March had largely been due to a range of regulated prices and previous increases in energy prices. The April CPI release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. The May outturn had been in line with expectations in the May Report. Core CPI inflation had been 3.5% in May, around 0.2 percentage points lower than expectations at the time of the May Report. 26: The ONS had announced in June that an error had been identified in an extract of the licensed vehicles data provided to the ONS by the Department for Transport. These data had been used to calculate the April 2025 Vehicle Excise Duty component of consumer price inflation. The error had resulted in an overstatement of the headline CPI by 0.1 percentage points for the published April 2025 figure only. The error had been corrected in the May data, such that going forward only the year-on-year rate of CPI inflation in April of next year would be distorted. 27: Core consumer goods price inflation had risen to 1.6% in May, alongside a material increase in food consumer price inflation, to 4.4%. Meat, chocolate and non-alcoholic drinks had exhibited the strongest inflation rates, consistent with higher wholesale prices for beef, cocoa beans and coffee. Agency intelligence had also highlighted the impact of labour and packaging regulation costs. 28: Consumer services price inflation had returned to 4.7% in May, having risen from that level in March to 5.4% in April. Underlying services price inflation had remained elevated across a broad range of measures, regardless of whether they were based on exclusionary, trimming or reweighting approaches. While these had been on a downward trajectory, there had been little change in the higher-frequency pace of underlying services price inflation since late 2024. 29: CPI inflation was expected to remain just under 3½% for the remainder of the year, with a brief increase to 3.7% in September. This profile was broadly unchanged from the projection made at the time of the May Report, although the pass-through to prices from National Insurance contributions, from regulatory changes and from some food input costs continued to require monitoring. 30: Some indicators of households’ short- and medium-term inflation expectations had fallen back in the latest data, but had remained at the upper end of the range of rates explicable by the path of consumer price inflation. The Citi/YouGov measure of median one-year ahead inflation expectations had declined to 4.0%, while the Bank/Ipsos measure had fallen to 3.2%. The increases in household expectations prior to the latest data could be explained by the response of households to actual inflation, in particular to increases in the prices of salient items such as food and energy prices. Nevertheless, this represented an upside risk to future pay and inflation dynamics. Medium-term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys had also remained elevated. 31: Measures of businesses’ inflation expectations had remained elevated but to a lesser extent than household measures. According to the DMP Survey, businesses’ year-ahead own-price expectations had fallen from 4.0% in the three months to February to 3.7% in the three months to May. Year-ahead CPI expectations had stood at 3.2%, up slightly from 3.1% in the three months to February. The immediate policy decision 32: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. 33: The Committee considered the news since the previous MPC meeting, particularly the extent to which it was sufficient to change members’ views on domestic inflationary pressures and hence the required stance of monetary policy. 34: Underlying UK GDP growth appeared to have remained weak and the labour market had continued to loosen. While there remained uncertainties around the balance of supply and demand in the economy, there was clearer evidence that a margin of slack had opened up over time in the labour market as had been expected. Members noted the continuing weakness in job vacancies, in the ratio of vacancies to unemployment relative to its estimated equilibrium level, and in ONS/HMRC PAYE payrolls even with less weight placed on the most recent data point, alongside the increase in net additional hours desired by workers. 35: Measures of pay growth had continued to moderate and, as in May, the Committee expected a significant slowing over the rest of the year. This was consistent with the now-more-representative sample of recorded pay settlements this spring, and with the broadly unchanged signals from the DMP Survey and Agents’ intelligence. The growing margin of slack in the labour market pointed to limited pay drift going forward. The Committee remained vigilant about the extent to which easing pay pressures would feed through to consumer price inflation. 36: Twelve-month CPI inflation had increased to 3.4% in May from 2.6% in March, in line with expectations in the May Monetary Policy Report. The rise had been largely due to a range of regulated prices and previous increases in energy prices. Services price inflation had been unchanged from March, at 4.7%. Food price inflation had risen materially in May, which might prove salient for households’ formation of inflation expectations. There had been some signs of levelling off in indicators of household expectations, but both household and business inflation expectations remained elevated. Financial market measures of inflation compensation were in contrast more subdued. 37: Consumer price inflation was expected to remain broadly at current rates throughout the remainder of the year before falling back towards target next year. While base effects would start to work to bring inflation down in 2025 Q4 and 2026 Q1, more pronounced disinflation was needed to ensure CPI inflation declined back towards the 2% target consistent with the baseline projection in the May Report. 38: The Committee remained focused on returning inflation sustainably to the target. Alongside the baseline forecast, the May Report had set out two illustrative scenarios. In one scenario, there could be weaker supply and more persistence in domestic wages and prices, including from second-round effects related to the near-term increase in CPI inflation. In another scenario, inflationary pressures could ease more quickly owing to greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically. The mechanisms underlying both scenarios remained relevant for the Committee’s deliberations, set alongside a broader assessment of risks. 39: Recent developments had highlighted a broad range of global risks, including but not restricted to trade policy. Global uncertainty remained elevated. 40: Based on the latest constellation of tariff announcements, provisional Bank staff analysis suggested that the direct impact of the trade shock on world GDP could be smaller than the Committee had expected in the May Report. Trade policy uncertainty would nevertheless continue to have an impact on the UK economy. 41: There had been rapid geopolitical developments in the lead up to this MPC meeting. Energy prices had risen owing to an escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. The Committee would remain vigilant about these developments and their potential impact on the UK economy. 42: Although monetary policy had been eased over the past year, the Committee had retained a restrictive stance in order to continue to squeeze out persistent inflationary pressures. There was a range of views among members on the remaining degree of restrictiveness. 43: All members stressed that monetary policy was not on a pre-set path. The Committee would remain sensitive to heightened unpredictability in the economic and geopolitical environment, and would continue to update its assessment of risks to the economy. 44: Six members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%. Disinflationary progress had continued, but there was not a strong case for a further easing of monetary policy at this meeting. Inflation seemed likely to stay around 3½% over the second half of 2025 before falling back towards the target from next year. There had generally been some greater signs of disinflationary pressures from the labour market, both in terms of quantities and wages, than from developments in domestic prices. Recent global developments had not had a significant impact on this meeting’s policy decision. 45: The risks around the medium-term path of CPI inflation remained two-sided. Assessing the pace of disinflation would continue to be key for these members in reaching a view on how quickly to remove remaining policy restraint. That assessment was likely to include a number of elements. Signs of weak demand, for example as a result of continued high saving, could lead to a more rapid opening up of slack in the labour market. In contrast, supply side constraints, such as continued weakness in productivity, or structural change in goods and labour markets could contribute to inflationary pressures. Inflation persistence could also be generated by higher food prices raising inflation expectations, impacting wage and price setting behaviours. 46: Three members preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. The cumulative evidence from a range of labour market data pointed to a material further loosening in labour market conditions. Private sector regular wage growth had come in lower than expected, while incoming pay settlements data had continued to be close to the Agents’ annual pay survey figure for the end of 2025, and were approaching sustainable rates. Consumer spending and underlying growth had remained subdued, alongside ongoing risks to global growth. The disinflation process was continuing, with the most significant contributions to the pickup in headline inflation coming from one-off tax and administered prices, though with uncertainty from global developments that needed monitoring. In the medium term, a continued monetary policy stance that was too restrictive risked inflation deviating from the 2% target on a sustained basis and the opening up of an unduly large output gap. Given this balance of risks, a less restrictive policy path was warranted. 47: Given the outlook, and continued disinflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remained appropriate. The Committee would continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence might reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting. 48: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 4.25%. 49: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members (Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted against the proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%. Operational considerations 50: On 18 June, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was £590 billion. 51: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Clare Lombardelli Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Alan Taylor Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. Jonathan Bewes was also present on 9 June, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 6 August will be published on 7 August 2025.

The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. At its meeting ending on 6 August 2025, the MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%, rather than maintaining it at 4.25%. There has been substantial disinflation over the past two and a half years, following previous external shocks, supported by the restrictive stance of monetary policy. That progress has allowed for reductions in Bank Rate over the past year. The Committee remains focused on squeezing out any existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures, to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target in the medium term. The path of disinflation in underlying domestic price and wage pressures has generally continued, albeit to different degrees. Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to 3.5% in 2025 Q2, owing to developments in energy, food and administered prices. Pay growth remains elevated, but has declined further recently, and is still expected to slow significantly over the rest of the year. Services consumer price inflation has been broadly flat over recent months. The Committee continues to be vigilant about the extent to which easing pay pressures will feed through to consumer price inflation. CPI inflation is forecast to increase slightly further to peak at 4.0% in September. Inflation is expected to fall back thereafter towards the 2% target, although the Committee remains alert to the risk that this temporary increase in inflation could put additional upward pressure on the wage and price-setting process. Overall, the MPC judges that the upside risks around medium-term inflationary pressures have moved slightly higher since May. Underlying UK GDP growth has remained subdued, consistent with a continued, gradual loosening in the labour market. A margin of slack is judged to have emerged in the economy. Downside domestic and geopolitical risks around economic activity remain, although trade policy uncertainty has diminished somewhat. At this meeting, the Committee voted to reduce Bank Rate to 4%. A gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remains appropriate. The restrictiveness of monetary policy has fallen as Bank Rate has been reduced. The timing and pace of future reductions in the restrictiveness of policy will depend on the extent to which underlying disinflationary pressures continue to ease. Monetary policy is not on a pre-set path, and the Committee will remain responsive to the accumulation of evidence. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 6 August 2025 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying August 2025 Monetary Policy Report . 2: The Committee discussed recent developments in international trade policies and their implications for the UK. US tariff rates had remained at higher levels than in the period preceding the initial announcements by the US administration in April. However, uncertainty around trade had reduced since the May Monetary Policy Report as the US had reached trade agreements with some countries. The reduction in tariff rates relative to those assumed in the May Report implied that global demand would be slightly stronger in the baseline projection. Global developments had, nevertheless, not played a large role in the policy discussions at this MPC meeting. 3: Developments in international trade policies had also generally supported sentiment in financial markets, such that financial conditions had loosened a little since the MPC’s June meeting. Measures of financial market volatility had either remained stable or fallen somewhat. UK and US equity prices had increased, with estimates of equity risk premia across advanced economies falling. Spreads on investment grade corporate bonds had tightened. 4: The near-term market-implied path for Bank Rate was relatively little changed since the Committee’s June meeting but was a little higher than the path assumed in the May Report. Almost all respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected a reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting, similar to market pricing. The median profile in the August MaPS implied a cumulative 50 basis point reduction in Bank Rate by the end of this year, broadly in line with market pricing. 5: Monthly UK GDP growth in April and May had been -0.3% and -0.1% respectively. These outturns suggested that stronger GDP growth earlier in the year had, in part, been driven by international tariff or domestic tax-related front-loading. The S&P Global UK PMI future output index had risen over past months, and the output index had also risen but by less. Bank staff estimated that GDP growth had been 0.1% in 2025 Q2, in line with the projection in the May Report, and growth was expected to pick up to 0.3% in Q3. 6: The Committee discussed the extent to which developments in activity had fed through to spare capacity in the economy. There had continued to be a gradual loosening in the labour market. Weak underlying employment growth in recent quarters had largely been ascribed to weakness in underlying demand and, more recently, an increase in firms’ costs. The LFS unemployment rate had increased further in the three months to May, as expected. Vacancies had remained below their estimated equilibrium levels, with other indicators and statistical models pointing to further increases in spare capacity. 7: The evidence from a range of sources and Bank staff analysis suggested that disinflation in underlying price and wage pressures had generally continued, albeit to different degrees. Annual private sector regular AWE growth had declined further in the most recent data, to just below 5%. This was weaker than expected in the May Report, but consistent with a range of other indicators. AWE growth nevertheless remained above what Bank models could explain. Developments in pay settlements, the latest DMP Survey and Agents’ intelligence suggested a further weakening in pay growth in coming quarters, to around 3¾% by the end of the year. 8: Twelve-month CPI inflation had increased to 3.6% in June, slightly above expectations at the time of both the May Report and the Committee’s June meeting, reflecting upside news in food, energy and services prices. Services price inflation had remained unchanged at 4.7% in June. Underlying services price inflation had continued to moderate, but at a slower pace than last year based on some measures. 9: CPI inflation was expected to rise a little further, to just over 3¾% in 2025 Q3, before falling back towards the 2% target. The return of inflation towards target would be supported by an expected gradual reduction in food price inflation next year. Box E in the August Report discussed the risks related to food price inflation, including the potential for it to have an outsized influence on households’ formation of inflation expectations. The Committee discussed the extent to which the lag from wage growth through to services price inflation was operating in line with historical trends. Looking beyond the temporary factors putting upward pressure on prices this year, wage and services price disinflation would be key drivers of CPI inflation settling sustainably at the target. The immediate policy decision 10: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. 11: The Committee’s policy deliberations at this meeting had focused on a number of factors, including the extent to which disinflation was continuing, the degree of slack building in the economy, and the current and future restrictiveness of the monetary policy stance. 12: Disinflation in underlying domestic price and wage pressures had generally continued, albeit to different degrees. Core CPI and services price inflation had been broadly unchanged in recent months. Continued moderation in wage growth was likely to feed through to lower services price inflation, although this process could take time and Committee members varied in their confidence in it. Headline inflation had risen and was projected to rise slightly further in the near term, although in the baseline projection this was not expected to lead to additional second-round effects on underlying domestic inflationary pressures. The increase in headline inflation was explicable by factors such as supply issues in certain food items and changes in administered prices. However, increases in food and energy price inflation might prove salient for households’ formation of inflation expectations. As illustrated in the inflation persistence scenario set out in the May Monetary Policy Report, this could place upward pressure on the wage and price-setting process. Overall, the MPC judged that the upside risks around medium-term inflationary pressures had moved slightly higher since May. 13: UK economic activity had remained subdued. A margin of spare capacity was estimated to have opened up, which was expected to act against some continuing inflationary persistence. There was a range of views around the extent to which it had opened and would continue to build. The labour market was continuing to loosen gradually. For some members, weak employment growth pointed to further spare capacity building. For others, potential structural changes in the labour market meant that sufficient slack might not have emerged and might not build further to weigh on inflation. Members concurred that there were generally downside risks around consumption growth in the baseline forecast and upside risks around the path of the saving ratio, including from the risk of greater precautionary saving behaviour by households. 14: The Committee considered Bank staff’s latest assessment of monetary policy restrictiveness, as set out in Box A in the accompanying August Report. Reflecting the usual lags of policy, past restrictiveness was estimated to be weighing on the current level of demand, which would contribute to the disinflationary process. For those members placing greater weight on downside risks to inflation, the impact of past and current restrictiveness was likely to be sufficient to lean against inflationary pressures and less restrictiveness was probably required going forward. Those members who were more concerned about inflationary pressures persisting judged that a more prolonged period of policy restrictiveness was likely to be warranted. 15: In considering the approach to removing remaining policy restraint at this meeting and beyond, all members were balancing various considerations. This included risks in different directions to growth and inflation, the degree of continued impact from past tightening in policy, the costs of loosening policy too quickly or too slowly, and whether and how long to wait and observe further incoming evidence before reducing Bank Rate further. 16: Five members preferred a reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. 17: Four of these five members preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. There had been sufficient progress in underlying disinflation albeit, for some of these members, with a risk that this momentum could slow. There remained greater signs of disinflation from labour market quantities and wages, than from developments in domestic prices. Activity remained weak. The pace of disinflation from here would help inform these members’ views on how quickly to remove remaining policy restraint. On the one hand, higher food prices could raise inflation expectations and generate greater inflation persistence. On the other hand, signs of weaker demand, for example as a result of the impact of continued high saving on consumption, could lead to a more rapid opening up of slack in the labour market. 18: One of these five members preferred a 0.5 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. Underlying disinflation continued. Absent external shocks, domestic inflation, especially in services, was tightly linked to wages. The labour market had slack and was deteriorating further. Wage settlements had fallen to around 3.5% in the first half of 2025 and were expected to fall further in the second half. The inflation hump was expected to normalise, being dominated by one-off changes in tax and administered prices, and food inflation in a limited set of items, neither related to demand pressure. Energy futures curves were flat. With a US average tariff rate near 20%, trade diversion would slowly permeate, pushing down on inflation. UK sentiment was weak, with subdued consumption and investment. This picture was one of downside risks in coming years, namely: inflation below forecast, and activity weak or an increased risk of recession. For insurance against this balance of risks, a less restrictive policy was warranted. 19: Four members preferred to hold Bank Rate at 4.25% at this meeting. The disinflationary process had slowed and the risk of inflation expectations feeding through to second-round effects had risen. Business and household inflation expectations remained elevated, inflation was expected to peak at 4% and much of the recent near-term upside news in inflation had been driven by highly salient food and energy prices. Firms’ own-price expectations remained more sensitive to upside inflation surprises as well. These members would continue to assess the pace of disinflation, being alert to downside pressures on pricing power from domestic demand and global forces, alongside the risk of greater inflation persistence from structural changes in goods and labour markets. A slower loosening of policy would reduce the risk of inflation not meeting the target sustainably. 20: The Committee judged that a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remained appropriate. The restrictiveness of monetary policy had fallen as Bank Rate had been reduced. The timing and pace of future reductions in the restrictiveness of policy would depend on the extent to which underlying disinflationary pressures would continue to ease. Monetary policy was not on a pre-set path, and the Committee would remain responsive to the accumulation of evidence. 21: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%. 22: Four members voted in favour of the proposition (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden). Four members (Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%. One member (Alan Taylor) preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 3.75%. 23: In order to secure a majority decision on Bank Rate, the Chair invited the Committee to vote on whether: Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%, or Bank Rate should be maintained at 4.25%. 24: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%. One of these members (Alan Taylor), who would otherwise have preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, voted for a 0.25 percentage points reduction rather than maintaining Bank Rate. Four members (Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%. 25: On this basis, the MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%, rather than maintaining it at 4.25%. Operational considerations 26: On 6 August, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was £586 billion. 27: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Clare Lombardelli Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Alan Taylor Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. David Roberts was present on 30 July and 4 August, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors.

The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. At its meeting ending on 17 September 2025, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to maintain Bank Rate at 4%. Two members voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.75%. The Committee voted by a majority of 7–2 to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes, and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £70 billion over the next 12 months, to a total of £488 billion. There has been substantial disinflation over the past two and a half years, following previous external shocks, supported by the restrictive stance of monetary policy. That progress has allowed for reductions in Bank Rate over the past year. The Committee remains focused on squeezing out any existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures, to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target in the medium term. Underlying disinflation has generally continued, although with greater progress in easing wage pressures than prices. Twelve-month CPI inflation was 3.8% in August, and is expected to increase slightly in September, before falling towards the 2% target thereafter. The Committee remains alert to the risk that this temporary increase in inflation could put additional upward pressure on the wage and price-setting process. Pay growth remains elevated, but has fallen and is expected to slow significantly over the rest of the year. Services consumer price inflation has been broadly flat over recent months. Upside risks around medium-term inflationary pressures remain prominent in the Committee’s assessment of the outlook. Underlying UK GDP growth has remained subdued, consistent with a continued, gradual loosening in the labour market, as well as a margin of slack in the economy. Downside domestic and geopolitical risks around economic activity remain. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4%. A gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remains appropriate. The restrictiveness of monetary policy has fallen as Bank Rate has been reduced. The timing and pace of future reductions in the restrictiveness of policy will depend on the extent to which underlying disinflationary pressures continue to ease. Monetary policy is not on a pre-set path, and the Committee will remain responsive to the accumulation of evidence. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 17 September 2025 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decisions, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The international economy 2: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.4% in 2025 Q2, a little stronger than had been assumed in the August Monetary Policy Report. Within that, euro-area GDP had expanded by 0.1% and US GDP by 0.8%. Robust US growth in Q2 had partly reflected an unwind of erratic weakness in Q1, which had been depressed by the front-loading of imports in anticipation of US tariff announcements. US final private domestic demand, which abstracted from some of the volatility associated with trade, had expanded by 0.5% in Q2, accounted for by robust business investment. 3: The euro-area and US labour markets had remained close to balance. The notable slowing in US employment growth this year appeared to have largely reflected lower labour supply growth. That was consistent with the relative stability of the US unemployment rate over this period, albeit suggesting increasing upside risks to US unemployment looking ahead. 4: Since the MPC’s August meeting, the US effective tariff rate had continued to rise and was now estimated to be close to 20%. The Committee discussed the extent to which higher tariff rates between the United States and its trading partners over the course of this year had impacted activity. Global growth had been resilient in recent months. This might, in part, have reflected front-loading of exports to the US, lags in the implementation of higher tariff rates, and the rerouting of some traded goods through alternative routes or to different destinations. There could also be impacts on activity from increased tariff rate dispersion between countries and across products. As such, the impact of higher tariff rates could be slower, although not necessarily smaller, than previously assumed. 5: Recent indicators suggested that the outlook for global growth in 2025 Q3 would be slightly stronger than had been assumed in the August Report. Looking further ahead, geopolitical risks around economic activity remained and the outlook for global trade policy continued to be highly uncertain. Aspects of US tariff policies were facing domestic legal challenge in coming weeks. Trade policy uncertainty was estimated to have increased slightly since the Committee’s August meeting, albeit it was still significantly lower than earlier in the year. 6: Twelve-month HICP euro-area inflation was unchanged at 2.0% in August, with core inflation remaining at 2.3%. Twelve-month US CPI inflation had increased to 2.9% in August from 2.7% in July, with core inflation remaining at 3.1%. Monetary and financial conditions 7: UK financial conditions were a little tighter compared with those at the time of the MPC’s previous meeting. This had largely reflected a shift up in the market-implied path for Bank Rate, and some appreciation in the sterling effective exchange rate, with slightly higher equity prices providing a limited offset. It was too soon to see a material impact of either the shift in the market-implied path or August’s Bank Rate reduction on the lending rates offered by banks to households and corporates, given the usual lags. More generally, annual growth in aggregate broad money had remained in line with the rate seen in 2025 so far. 8: Market participants had attributed the rise in UK short-term interest rates to the Committee’s August and subsequent communications, alongside UK data developments. In contrast, the rise in longer-maturity gilt yields over the same period had been accounted for by global factors to a greater degree, reflecting a continued increase in term premia that was in large part related to the fiscal outlook in advanced economies. 9: At its meeting on 11 September, the European Central Bank Governing Council had maintained its deposit facility rate at 2%, in line with market expectations. At its meeting ending on 17 September, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee was expected to reduce the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. 10: Market expectations were for Bank Rate to remain unchanged at this meeting. In the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS), the distribution of Bank Rate expectations had shifted upwards relative to the August survey, consistent with the relatively shallower profile of cuts implied by market pricing. 11: The vast majority of MaPS respondents expected the overall pace of reduction in the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes to be slower over the coming year relative to the preceding 12 months. In recent months, the largest cluster of responses had remained in the £70 to £85 billion range, although the distribution had shifted down such that the latest median expectation was for a stock reduction of £65 billion. Demand and output 12: UK GDP had risen by 0.3% in 2025 Q2, stronger than the 0.1% increase that had been expected in the August Monetary Policy Report. Household consumption had risen by 0.1%, while business investment had fallen by 4.0% unwinding a similar-sized increase in Q1. Government expenditure had risen by 2.0% in Q2. Within the external trade data, UK export volumes to the United States had fallen by 27% in Q2, accounted for by weakness in vehicle and metal exports. 13: The level of monthly GDP had been unchanged in July, following a 0.4% rise in June. Private-sector services activity had also been flat on the month, while manufacturing output had declined quite sharply. Export volumes to the United States had increased by 20% on the month, however, consistent with the bounce-back that was expected following the agreement of the UK-US Economic Prosperity Deal. 14: Most business surveys, which were likely to be more reflective of market sector rather than public sector output, had picked up somewhat over recent months. For example, the S&P Global UK composite PMI output index had risen to 53.5 in August, only slightly below its historical average, and accounted for by a pickup in service-sector activity. The future output PMI had also increased to close to average. Nevertheless, Agents’ intelligence suggested that business sentiment had remained low. Most contacts were not expecting any substantial pickup in activity until 2026. 15: Taken together, the steer from business surveys and other intelligence was consistent with a slight increase in the pace of underlying growth in the second half of this year, to around ¼% per quarter. This was broadly consistent with the median of the non-parametric probability distribution around 2025 Q3 GDP growth generated by Bank staff’s quantile mixed-data sampling model, although there was also a significant downside skew in that distribution. 16: Incorporating the bounce-back in trade volumes, Bank staff expected headline GDP to increase by around 0.4% in 2025 Q3, slightly stronger than the underlying trend in growth. Supply, costs and prices 17: Consistent with the subdued outlook for activity, firms’ demand for labour and hiring intentions had softened further. Survey-based measures, such as the S&P Global UK composite PMI and the KPMG/REC Report on Jobs, indicated that hiring momentum had remained weak. The latest Agents’ intelligence pointed to an easing in recruitment difficulties and gradual reductions in employment intentions. Notwithstanding some dispersion among outturns from individual employment indicators, an estimate of underlying employment growth calculated by Bank staff had remained near zero. This weakness continued to be partly attributable to the impact of increases in employers’ National Insurance contributions (NICs), as suggested by respondents to the Decision Maker Panel (DMP) Survey. 18: The ratio of vacancies to unemployment had continued to fall below Bank staff’s estimate of its equilibrium level. Vacancies had declined in the three months to August, with falls broad-based across sectors, but at a somewhat slower pace than previously. The unemployment rate had been unchanged in the three months to July. The overall weakening in earlier-stage indicators of the tightness of the labour market were expected to lead to some modest deterioration in late-stage indicators, such as the redundancy rate, in due course. Taken together, slack was continuing to build slowly in the labour market, although with no signs currently that a sharper loosening was underway. 19: A broad set of indicators suggested that pay growth had continued to ease, although it had remained at levels above those that could be explained by economic fundamentals. Private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE) growth had fallen to 4.7% in the three months to July, down from 4.8% in the three months to June. Higher-frequency estimates of AWE growth had continued to moderate. Median private sector pay growth derived from HMRC payrolls had also weakened in July, although to a lesser extent. 20: The latest data on pay settlements and pay expectations had remained consistent with the August Monetary Policy Report projection for a significant decline in wage growth, to around 3.8% by year-end. The latest intelligence from the Agents had continued to suggest that average pay settlements for 2025 would be in line with the range reported in the Agents’ annual pay survey and the DMP Survey. Despite the expected decline in pay growth, the impact of the increase in employers’ NICs appeared to be delaying a reduction in total labour cost growth until next year. 21: Twelve-month CPI inflation had been 3.8% in August, in line with expectations in the August Report, following 3.8% in July and 3.6% in June. This had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. The rise in headline inflation this year was largely accounted for by increases in a range of administered prices and food prices, alongside the impact on inflation from previous falls in energy prices dropping out of the annual comparison. Core CPI inflation had been 3.6% in August, in line with expectations at the time of the August Report. 22: Core consumer goods price inflation had been 1.6% in August, with an increase in food price inflation to 5.1%. Intelligence from the Banks’ Agents pointed to higher global and domestic commodity prices as having accounted for much of the increase over the past year, with higher wholesale prices for beef, cocoa beans and coffee in particular. Labour costs and costs associated with new packaging regulation had also accounted for some of the increase in food prices. 23: Services consumer price inflation had fallen to 4.7% in August from 5.0% in July, and compared to 4.7% in May and June. This elevated level of services inflation reflected past strength in wage growth, temporary upward pressures from firms adjusting to labour costs from the employers’ NICs increase, and increases in administered prices. There had been signs of continuing disinflation in some measures of underlying services inflation. 24: CPI inflation was projected to stay around 3¾% over the second half of this year, with a temporary peak of 4.0% in September, in line with the projection in the August Report. This continued to reflect some near-term upward pressure on inflation largely from food and services prices, which was expected to be offset during 2025 Q4 by a slight decline in projected core goods and energy inflation. 25: Households’ short and medium-term inflation expectations had remained elevated relative to historical averages, likely reflecting a heightened attentiveness to the rise in headline CPI inflation in recent months, and particularly in food items. The Citi/YouGov measure of median one-year ahead inflation expectations had remained at 4.0%, while the Bank/Ipsos measure had increased to 3.6%. Both medium-term measures were elevated. In particular, the Bank/Ipsos measure had increased to a series-high of 3.8%. 26: Measures of businesses’ inflation expectations had risen to a lesser extent than household measures. According to the DMP Survey, businesses’ year-ahead own-price expectations remained at 3.7% in the three months to August, unchanged from the July outturn. Year-ahead CPI expectations had risen slightly to 3.3%. 27: Near-term inflation expectations reported in the Market Participants Survey had increased, with the median profile for CPI inflation implying a peak of 3.9% in the third quarter of this year. The median respondent had continued to expect inflation to be at the 2% target at the three-year horizon. There had been little change in medium-term UK financial market inflation compensation measures. The immediate policy decisions 28: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. Bank Rate decision 29: The Committee’s deliberations at this meeting had focused on a number of key policy questions, including the extent of progress on underlying disinflation, and the balance between upside risks from inflation persistence and downside risks to demand and, in turn, inflation. 30: Underlying disinflation had generally continued. Pay growth remained elevated, but had fallen and was expected to slow significantly over the rest of the year. Services consumer price inflation had been broadly flat over recent months, and was likely to remain around these levels in the near term in part reflecting developments in administered prices. Continued moderation in wage growth was likely to feed through to lower total labour cost and services price inflation over time, but there was uncertainty about how long this process would take. The MPC would continue to monitor closely developments in services CPI data, other indicators of pricing intentions such as in the DMP Survey, and profit margins. 31: Twelve-month CPI inflation had been 3.8% in August, and was expected to increase slightly in September, before falling towards the 2% target thereafter. The Committee remained alert to the risk that this temporary increase in inflation could put additional upward pressure on the wage and price-setting process, including via developments in salient items such as food prices and as headline inflation was likely to stay higher for longer above the 2% target relative to the May Monetary Policy Report. Some indicators of inflation expectations had also continued to increase over recent months, and the MPC was focused on the extent to which this could lead to renewed second-round effects. In general, upside risks around medium-term inflationary pressures remained prominent in the Committee’s assessment. 32: Underlying UK GDP growth had remained subdued, consistent with a continued, gradual loosening in the labour market, as well as a margin of slack in the economy. There remained uncertainty around the degree to which slack had opened up and would continue to build. Weak employment growth pointed to further spare capacity building and some indicators of labour demand had continued to soften. Set against that, possible structural changes in the labour market over recent years meant that sufficient slack might not have emerged to return inflation sustainably to target. There were also signs that output growth was now stronger than employment growth, alongside the possibility that adjustments in hiring related to recent increases in firms’ costs had now largely occurred. 33: As set out in Box A in the August Report, and reflecting the usual lags of policy, the past restrictiveness of the UK monetary policy stance was estimated to be weighing on the current level of demand, which would contribute to the disinflationary process. The degree of restrictiveness was, however, also estimated to have fallen over the past 18 months as Bank Rate had been reduced. 34: Downside domestic and geopolitical risks around economic activity remained. Members continued to judge that there were downside risks around consumption growth and upside risks around the path of the saving ratio, including from the risk of greater precautionary saving behaviour by households. Greater uncertainty could also lead to downside risks to business investment. There appeared, however, to be less of an immediate risk that the labour market would loosen very rapidly. Although global growth had so far been resilient, risks from trade policy developments remained and could be slower to materialise. 35: Seven members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4% at this meeting. Alongside a small tightening in financial conditions, there had been limited economic news since the previous MPC meeting, and these members’ views on the main risks and the required strategy to achieve the 2% target sustainably in the medium term had not changed materially. The key question for monetary policy remained whether upside risks to the continuing process of disinflation, from elevated inflation expectations and possible structural changes in price and wage-setting behaviour, could be outweighed by downside risks stemming from the potential for a more substantial weakening in demand. There remained a range of views among these members about the balance of risks to inflation, and the most important factors contributing to it. 36: Two members preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate. The disinflation process was continuing. The inflation hump was expected to normalise, with the most significant contributions coming from one-off changes in administered prices and global food inflation in a limited set of items, neither related to demand pressure. Consumer spending and investment remained subdued, while wage settlements had fallen further from around 3.5% in the first half of 2025. Along with domestic demand weakness and emerging slack, recent developments pointed to downward risks to global growth. Given this balance of risks, a less restrictive policy path was warranted to insure against an increased risk of recession, below-target inflation and a further deterioration in supply capacity. 37: The Committee judged that a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remained appropriate. The restrictiveness of monetary policy had fallen as Bank Rate had been reduced. The timing and pace of future reductions in the restrictiveness of policy would depend on the extent to which underlying disinflationary pressures would continue to ease. Monetary policy was not on a pre-set path, and the Committee would remain responsive to the accumulation of evidence. Annual decision on the pace of reduction in the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes 38: In line with the commitment made in the August 2022 MPC minutes, the Committee had again reviewed the pace of reduction in the stock of UK government bonds (gilts) held for monetary policy purposes in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF), a process known as quantitative tightening (QT). 39: QT had continued to contribute to meeting the Committee’s objective of reducing the risk of a ratchet upwards in the size of the Bank’s balance sheet over time, increasing the headroom and flexibility available to the Bank to use its balance sheet in the future if needed. 40: The MPC would continue to be guided by a set of key principles. First, the Committee intended to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Second, sales would be conducted so as not to disrupt the functioning of financial markets, and only in appropriate conditions. Third, to help achieve that, sales would be conducted in a gradual and predictable manner over a period of time. 41: The Committee had set out its latest assessment of QT in the August 2025 Monetary Policy Report. In setting Bank Rate, the MPC had taken account of financial market conditions that reflected the effects of announced and expected QT. Any tightening effect from QT would have led to a slightly lower path for Bank Rate, all else equal. Given that the impact of QT was judged to have been modest, this was unlikely to have made a material difference to the appropriate path for Bank Rate over the past year. 42: The MPC recognised that, as well as being uncertain, the effect of QT might vary over time. In common with other advanced economies, term premia on long-term government bonds had risen through 2025. That had reflected global economic policy uncertainty, high issuance of government bonds across countries and structural changes within the UK bond market that had reduced demand for long-term government debt. Although the UK gilt market had continued to function in an orderly manner, these factors could pose a risk that QT would have a greater impact on market functioning than previously. 43: Over the previous 12 months, following the MPC’s September 2024 decision about the pace of QT, the stock of gilts held for monetary policy purposes had been reduced by £100 billion, of which £13 billion had been through gilt sales. 44: At its September 2025 meeting, the Committee considered the case for the Bank to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes by £70 billion from October 2025 to September 2026, of which £21 billion would be through gilt sales. 45: Seven members supported that stock reduction. A decrease in the pace of QT to £70 billion from £100 billion over the previous year, would be consistent with the MPC’s key principles and objective. This decision was made with the knowledge that the Bank would choose as part of its operational considerations to vary the maturity composition of sales, as set out in the Market Notice accompanying these Minutes. 46: One member preferred to maintain the pace of QT at £100 billion over the coming year to provide continuity and consistency in the MPC’s approach, particularly as gilt market developments had been predominantly unrelated to QT. 47: One member preferred to slow the pace of QT to £62 billion, retaining £13 billion of sales, having been informed that in this case the Bank would maintain equal proportions of sales across maturity buckets, as in previous years. Relative to the majority decision, the slower pace and balanced tenors would reduce the potential for volatility in short rates and would moderate upward pressure on the middle tenor interest rates, which was where monetary policy transmission was the strongest. 48: The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) had been briefed ahead of the MPC’s decision. 49: All MPC members reaffirmed that there would be a high bar for amending the planned reduction in the stock of purchased gilts outside a scheduled annual review. That was in order to remain consistent with the principles that Bank Rate should be the active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and that gilt sales undertaken through QT should be predictable. In judging whether that bar was met, the FPC would also have a role through its assessment of financial stability. 50: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 4%; and The Bank of England should reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes, and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £70 billion over the next 12 months, to a total of £488 billion. 51: Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the first proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor) voted against this proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.75%. 52: Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted in favour of the second proposition. Two members voted against this proposition. Catherine L Mann preferred a stock reduction of £62 billion. Huw Pill preferred a stock reduction of £100 billion. Operational considerations 53: On 17 September, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was £558 billion. 54: At this meeting, the MPC had voted to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes by £70 billion over the 12-month period from October 2025 to September 2026. The details of the first quarter of the associated gilt sales programme, covering 2025 Q4, were set out in a Market Notice accompanying these minutes. 55: Since gilt sales had commenced in 2022 Q4, the Bank had scheduled auctions in order to reduce the APF as evenly as possible across maturity sectors. For the year starting 2025 Q4, the Bank would aim to sell fewer long maturity sector gilts than gilts at other maturities, such that approximately 40% of the MPC’s target would be met by selling short maturity sector bonds, 40% by medium maturity sector bonds, and 20% by long maturity sector bonds, measured in initial proceeds terms. The MPC had been briefed on these operational arrangements. 56: The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, Chair Sarah Breeden Swati Dhingra Megan Greene Clare Lombardelli Catherine L Mann Huw Pill Dave Ramsden Alan Taylor Sam Beckett was present as the Treasury representative. Jonathan Bewes was present on 15 September, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Bank’s Court of Directors. The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the Committee meeting ending on 5 November will be published on 6 November 2025.

Four members voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.75%. CPI inflation is judged to have peaked. Progress on underlying disinflation continues, supported by the still restrictive stance of monetary policy. This is reflected in an easing of pay growth and services price inflation. Underlying disinflation is being underpinned by subdued economic growth and building slack in the labour market. Monetary policy is being set to balance the risks around meeting the 2% inflation target sustainably. The risk from greater inflation persistence has become less pronounced recently, and the risk to medium-term inflation from weaker demand more apparent, such that overall the risks are now more balanced. But more evidence is needed on both. The restrictiveness of monetary policy has fallen as Bank Rate has been reduced. The extent of further reductions will therefore depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. If progress on disinflation continues, Bank Rate is likely to continue on a gradual downward path. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 5 November 2025 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) discussed key economic developments and its judgements around them, as well as its views on monetary policy strategy. The latest data and analysis underpinning these topics were set out in the accompanying November 2025 Monetary Policy Report . The Committee’s discussions 2: The Committee’s policy discussions covered: the extent to which disinflation was continuing; the degree of slack emerging in the economy and the extent to which this slack was sufficient to counteract any remaining persistence in underlying inflation; and the extent to which these developments reflected the restrictive stance of monetary policy, both currently and prospectively. 3: Progress on underlying disinflation had continued. Services consumer price inflation had eased. Continued moderation in wage growth was likely to feed through to lower services price inflation, although members continued to take different views on the degree of this pass-through. 4: CPI inflation was judged to have peaked. The increase in headline inflation over the course of this year had been accounted for by base effects in energy prices, as well as one-off factors such as supply disruptions in specific food components and increases in administered prices. In the central projection, this increase in headline inflation did not lead to additional second-round effects on domestic inflationary pressures. However, the Committee was mindful of recent increases in household inflation expectations, and some members continued to place weight on the possibility that structural shifts in wage and price-setting would exacerbate the persistence of underlying inflation. 5: In one scenario set out in Section 3 of the November Monetary Policy Report, inflation was more persistent than assumed in the central projection, as past inflation outturns continued to influence domestic price and wage-setting over the medium term. Among those members who placed weight on upside risks from inflation persistence more generally, there were different views on the most likely mechanism. 6: Looking ahead, contemporaneous indicators of slack, labour costs and services inflation, together with indications of prospective pay settlements and the likely pricing power of firms, would provide important information on the evolution of risks associated with returning CPI inflation to the 2% target sustainably. The Committee would evaluate the accumulation of evidence over time, alongside key upcoming data releases. The Budget would be announced on 26 November. 7: For most members, global developments had not played a large role in their policy deliberations at this meeting, but these would continue to be assessed closely. 8: Underlying disinflation was being underpinned by subdued economic growth and building slack in the labour market. Members had a range of views around the margin of spare capacity that had already emerged and was likely to emerge over time. The labour market was continuing to loosen gradually. For some members, weak growth in consumption and employment indicated the emergence of additional spare capacity. For other members, structural changes in the labour market implied that the margin of spare capacity, its likely evolution, and its implications for nominal dynamics, might prove insufficient to return inflation to target sustainably. 9: In a second scenario set out in the November Report, domestic inflationary pressure faded more quickly than was assumed in the central projection, reflecting more pronounced weakness in household consumption. Most members placed some weight on this scenario. 10: Reflecting the usual lags associated with monetary policy, past restrictiveness was assessed to be weighing on the current level of aggregate demand. This policy restraint was contributing to ongoing disinflation. For those members placing greater weight on downside risks to activity, the combined degree of past and current restrictiveness evident in the latest data risked an inflation undershoot in the medium term. For those members who were more concerned about the persistence of underlying inflationary pressures, there was less evidence that the cumulative restrictiveness imparted by policy to date would generate additional slack in the real economy. All members concurred that the stance of monetary policy had become less restrictive as the level of Bank Rate had been reduced. 11: In considering its approach to the potential removal of remaining policy restrictiveness, the Committee was weighing various considerations. These included the costs associated with loosening policy too quickly or too slowly, and the value in waiting for additional evidence before reducing Bank Rate further. Those considerations reflected different views on the restrictiveness of current monetary policy and on the extent to which incremental news would help resolve uncertainty about the persistence of inflation. 12: Different members placed different weights on how precisely an equilibrium, or neutral, level of Bank Rate could be identified. For some members, the evolution of inflation and other conjunctural data, including what these could reveal about slack, could offer guidance on the restrictiveness of monetary policy. Other members put more weight on quantitative estimates of equilibrium interest rates. There was broad agreement, however, that as Bank Rate approached neutral, the contribution of monetary policy to underlying disinflation would become harder to discern, making the case for further policy easing more finely balanced. 13: Taken together, the recent data suggested that the risk from greater inflation persistence had become less pronounced, and the risk to medium-term inflation from weaker demand more apparent, such that overall the risks were now more balanced. But more evidence was needed on both, and different members placed different weights on these risks. The immediate policy decision 14: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. 15: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4% at this meeting. Four members in this group (Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) placed greater weight on risks of persistence in inflation, requiring more prolonged monetary policy restriction. While there had been some progress in underlying disinflation, these members were concerned that this could stall, as they placed particular weight on the risk of higher inflation expectations or structural shifts leading to inflation persistence. One member in this group (Andrew Bailey) judged that the overall risks to medium-term inflation had moved down to become more balanced recently. But there was value in waiting for further evidence. 16: Four members (Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. Disinflation had become better established, and current and prospective slack should allow underlying inflation to return to target-consistent rates. These members attached a greater weight to downside risks, given that these would reflect a continuation of current trends, with particular concerns that household saving would remain elevated and weigh on consumption. For two members in this group (Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor), policy was already significantly over-restrictive, which could unduly damage activity and possibly lead to an undershoot in inflation in the medium term. 17: The Committee judged that the restrictiveness of monetary policy had fallen as Bank Rate had been reduced. The extent of further reductions would therefore depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. If progress on disinflation continued, Bank Rate was likely to continue on a gradual downward path. 18: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 4%. 19: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted in favour of the proposition. Four members (Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted against this proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.75%.

References in parentheses relate to boxes and sections of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report. References to scenarios relate to those set out in Section 3 of the November Report. Votes to maintain Bank Rate at 4% Andrew Bailey: Upside risks to inflation have become less pressing since August, and I see further policy easing to come if disinflation becomes more clearly established in the period ahead. Recent evidence points to building slack in the economy, and the latest CPI data were promising. But this is just one month of data. Labour costs remain elevated and wage growth, while on a downward path of late, may plateau. In assessing the outlook, I find the mechanisms underlying upside risks less convincing than those underlying the downside. Previous negative labour supply shocks could be less important for the trajectory of inflation today (Box F). Firms’ margin rebuilding may be mitigated by weak demand (Box A), and elevated household inflation expectations may have more limited impact (Box B). The downside scenario seems more likely. It could help explain the elevated saving rate, and Agents’ intelligence on uncertainty. Rather than cutting Bank Rate now, I would prefer to wait and see if the durability in disinflation is confirmed in upcoming economic developments this year. Current market pricing is close to the path suggested by a forward-looking Taylor rule (Annex 1), which is a fair description of my position at present. Megan Greene: I continue to believe inflation risks are to the upside and worry that the disinflationary process has slowed. Household inflation expectations remain elevated and inflation has been above a threshold increasing the risk of second-round effects for six months (Box C). Despite labour market easing, Decision Maker Panel and Agents’ steers suggest wage growth will remain high next year, indicating that the wage-setting process may have changed. Firms’ cost pressures have increased, potentially slowing the disinflationary process further (Box A). There is a risk of weaker consumption but, if motivated by scarring from recent inflationary episodes, this is best addressed by bringing inflation back to target. All but one of the policy simulations across the central projection and both scenarios argue for a prolonged pause in Bank Rate to lean against inflation (Annex 1). I am not convinced the monetary policy stance is meaningfully restrictive. There is huge uncertainty around the neutral rate, but as we approach it the risk of cutting too far or too fast rises and it becomes more difficult to discern whether inflation is driven by the monetary policy stance or underlying dynamics. I believe it is prudent to hold policy steady to ensure disinflation remains on track. Clare Lombardelli: While I expect headline inflation to continue to fall, I worry there may be more underlying inflationary pressure in the economy than embodied in the central projection. Despite recent softer-than-expected data, forward-looking indicators of inflation have been less benign, particularly around pay settlements next year. Structural changes in the labour market (Box F) may mean there is less slack in the economy, leading to more persistent inflationary pressures. Higher inflation expectations and associated threshold effects (Box B and Box C) may have changed wage and price-setting behaviour. In such a scenario, we would need a longer period of restrictive monetary policy to bring inflation sustainably back to target. And it is uncertain how restrictive policy is currently. While I find the ongoing weaker consumption scenario compelling (Box D), we have plenty of policy space to lower Bank Rate should it be necessary, while a policy reversal would be costly for the MPC’s credibility. Catherine L Mann: The inflation persistence scenario is my central case. Price dynamics are unlikely to follow the rapid deceleration shown in the central projection. Administered prices could jump again, elevated household inflation expectations risk further second-round effects (Box B), and wage inflation is expected to remain above target-consistent levels next year. Core goods inflation remains high, with little sign so far of downward pressure from geopolitical factors, global economic developments, or the exchange rate. Monetary policy needs to rein in both inflation and expectations drift so as to reinforce commitment to our 2% target. I place some weight on the lower demand scenario. However, activity and labour market indicators are easing only slowly. Weaker market-sector output and greater slack in the private labour market have been offset by growth in government spending and employment. Policy restrictiveness is past its peak and continues to moderate, particularly through the lens of recent credit indicators. Because the high saving ratio reflects inflation’s erosion of real wealth, and buffers against purchasing-power uncertainty, holding a firm stance against inflation is needed. Therefore, both scenarios support a vote to hold. Huw Pill: I continue to prefer a slower pace for the withdrawal of monetary policy restriction than delivered over the past 18 months, reflecting my longstanding concern that structural changes in price and wage-setting behaviour have generated stronger intrinsic inflation persistence in the UK, resulting in more sustained above-target underlying inflation. In general, I place more weight on lower-frequency trends in inflation, and less weight on short-term innovations in headline inflation. The former are influenced by a monetary policy that transmits with long lags, whereas that is less the case for the latter. As a result, my concerns follow less from the risks captured in the upside scenario and more from the upside risks stemming from structural changes. Concerns about structural change are motivated by continued strength in services and wage inflation despite the apparent emergence of slack, and are supported by micro-level evidence on participation (Box F). Given that a policy based on erroneous real-time estimates of the economy’s resting place can require costly correction, my concerns on this dimension argue for a cautious approach to further policy easing. Votes to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.75% Sarah Breeden: Data since August have provided me with greater confidence that the disinflation process remains on track and that upside risks to inflation are not materialising. I judge that a degree of slack has and will continue to open up in the labour market, which should continue to dampen pay growth. Bank staff analysis and Agency intelligence on profit margins have given me further confidence that the slowdown in firms’ wage costs will be passed through to prices (Box A). While the upside risks to inflation have diminished somewhat since the August Report, downside risks from the outlook for demand have become more prominent. I think it plausible that a structural change in household behaviour means that the saving rate stays elevated (Box D). Combined with my view that policy remains restrictive and slack continues to build, this gives me enough confidence to cut now. We will need a higher accumulation of evidence on disinflation as we feel our way towards neutral next year, where I see benefits in retaining some insurance against potential structural changes in the labour market (Box F). But in the absence of conclusive evidence that this is happening, I support a gradual policy reduction now. Swati Dhingra: Disinflation remains clearly on track, with balanced risks to inflation and downside risks to activity. Food price inflation, while concerning, may have limited scope to generate second-round effects (Box B) and acting pre-emptively to counteract a mechanism little influenced by UK monetary policy risks potential policy errors. Labour market slack should lean against potential upside risks from inflation expectations. Vacancies have fallen further, while slack may be larger than estimated given high net desired hours and a mechanical overstatement of the NAIRU. The strength of past wage growth is more likely to reflect post-pandemic churn rather than structural shifts. Weak demand should continue to constrain firms’ ability to raise prices (Box A). Bank Rate reductions may have limited countervailing effects on the consumption outlook, due to a continuing drag from the mortgage cash-flow channel and a rise in precautionary savings (Box D). Compared to the downside scenario, I am more concerned about the mix of demand and supply reflected in activity. My view remains that Bank Rate should have been lower already to account for lags in its transmission to the real economy. Policy is overly restrictive and could exacerbate risks from weak demand and reduced supply. Dave Ramsden: I place weight on our central projection and see risks around it as broadly balanced, although the downside risks are now more prominent for me relative to August, particularly as previous uncertainties around the disinflation process have reduced. Activity is subdued, the labour market is loosening materially and the inflation hump has played out largely as expected. Bank staff analysis on firms’ costs and margins suggest that, as labour cost pressures dissipate, prices will follow suit (Box A). I find the mechanisms in the downside scenario plausible (Box D). Households’ worries about the outlook may continue to keep the saving ratio elevated. And weaker SME cash flow positions should be kept in mind (Box E), particularly given the rising unemployment projection in the forecast. When assessing upside risks, analysis on the salience of different components for inflation expectations has persuaded me that the impact on the current wage-setting process will be modest (Box B). A more compelling potential upside risk comes from the supply side, though there is currently little supporting evidence (Box F). I judge that our policy stance continues to be restrictive and, based on my outlook, expect that a gradual removal of policy restraint will remain appropriate. Alan Taylor: I disagree with the central projection and my own outlook is weaker. I judge that the current level of slack is larger, and the terminal rate is lower, implying that the current stance is more restrictive than intended. I place more weight on downside risks to inflation, which would materialise if current trends continue, rather than upside risks, which would require new developments to emerge. Data indicate weakening demand and low confidence. The saving rate is more likely to remain elevated (Box D). Inflation has undershot expectations and should fall from here as temporary factors fade, while the labour market continues to soften. Peak unemployment is yet to come, may endure for some time, and our projections for it have drifted higher over successive forecasts. The evidence suggests limited second-round effects from food prices (Box B). Instead, I place weight on our other models that suggest inflation may not stop falling in the second half of next year and could undershoot. I favour reducing restrictiveness now, with more easing likely to come, as insurance against depressed activity amid such an inflation undershoot. This still leaves scope to pause later as needed, or to respond if upside risks materialise.

Four members voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4%. CPI inflation has fallen since the previous meeting, to 3.2%. Although above the 2% target, it is now expected to fall back towards target more quickly in the near term. Reflecting restrictive monetary policy, and consistent with evidence of subdued economic growth and building slack in the labour market, pay growth and services price inflation have continued to ease. Monetary policy is being set to ensure CPI inflation settles sustainably at 2% in the medium term, which involves balancing the risks around achieving this. The risk from greater inflation persistence has become somewhat less pronounced since the previous meeting, while the risk to medium-term inflation from weaker demand remains. The extent of further easing in monetary policy will depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. The restrictiveness of policy has fallen as Bank Rate has been reduced by 150 basis points since August 2024. On the basis of the current evidence, Bank Rate is likely to continue on a gradual downward path. But judgements around further policy easing will become a closer call. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 17 December 2025 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) discussed key economic developments and its judgements around them, as well as its views on monetary policy strategy. Current economic conditions 2: Twelve-month CPI inflation had eased to 3.2% in November from 3.6% in October and 3.8% in September. This was below the short-term forecast published in the November Monetary Policy Report, largely reflecting downside news to food price inflation. The October release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. 3: Services consumer price inflation was 4.4% in November, compared with the most recent peak of 5.4% in April. Measures of underlying services price inflation had pointed to the disinflation process continuing, as pay growth had eased. The impacts of one-off shocks to the price level, such as the employers’ National Insurance Contributions increases and unusually large increases in some administered prices earlier in the year, had continued to restrain this downward trend to a degree. 4: CPI inflation was expected to ease further in 2026 Q1, to around 3%. Before that, CPI inflation was expected to rise temporarily in December 2025, owing to an increase in tobacco duty and a pickup in airfares price inflation. 5: Some measures announced in the Budget, in particular one-off reductions to regulatory costs levied on households’ energy bills, and changes to fuel duty, were likely to lower CPI inflation in April by around ½ percentage point. This Budget news, in combination with other news in recent CPI data and with some downward moves in sterling oil and gas futures curves since November, had led Bank staff to lower their expectation for CPI inflation to closer to 2% in 2026 Q2. 6: There had been small movements in inflation expectations over recent months. Market measures of medium-term inflation compensation had been little changed since the MPC’s November meeting. The Bank/Ipsos and Citi/YouGov indicators of households’ short and medium-term inflation expectations had eased slightly in November, albeit remaining at elevated levels. The Decision Maker Panel (DMP) survey had reported that firms’ year-ahead own-price inflation expectations rose slightly to 3.7% in the three months to November and were close to realised own-price inflation, suggesting that firms continued to expect little change in inflation a year ahead. Intelligence from the Banks’ Agents suggested that firms did not expect to pass on fully increases in costs given the weak demand environment. 7: A range of indicators suggested that pay growth had continued to ease in the second half of 2025, particularly in the private sector. Annual growth in whole economy Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had declined to 4.7% in the three months to October. AWE private sector regular pay growth had fallen to 3.9%, which was in line with the forecast in the November Report. While still elevated, this rate of pay growth could be broadly explained by economic fundamentals, in contrast to developments over the past few years when pay growth had been stronger than could be explained. Bank staff expected private sector regular AWE pay growth to ease to around 3½% in 2025 Q4, predominantly owing to base effects, which reflected the strength in pay growth at the end of 2024. A range of pay settlements data suggested that the median private-sector settlement had been around 3% in the three months to November, although fewer companies agreed their settlements at this time of the year. 8: Forward-looking wage indicators had remained elevated. Ahead of the Agents’ annual pay survey, which would be a key input into the February MPC round, the Agents’ contacts had suggested that pay settlements were expected to be around 3½% in 2026. This was still an elevated level, although it was nearly ½ percentage point lower than figures reported for 2025. The November DMP survey had reported a slight increase in firms’ twelve-month ahead pay expectations to 3.8%, suggesting that pay growth might not ease materially further into next year. 9: The labour market had loosened further. The LFS unemployment rate had risen to 5.1% in the three months to October, 0.2 percentage points above the expectation in the November Report. The LFS redundancy rate had risen to 5.3 per 1,000 employees, its highest level since 2013, outside of the Covid pandemic period. But this series was prone to volatility, and the latest increase had not been mirrored in HR1 redundancy notifications. In contrast, the level of vacancies had been broadly stable since the summer. Employment growth had remained subdued. An HMRC payrolls estimate of private sector employees had fallen even further than the headline HMRC estimate in the three months to November, extending a recent pattern of weakness. Public sector employment had been stronger. 10: GDP growth had eased to 0.1% in 2025 Q3, slightly below the rate expected in the November Report. Bank staff analysis had suggested that some of this softening was erratic, with underlying quarterly GDP growth closer to 0.2%. Monthly GDP had declined by 0.1% in October, due to a further fall in market sector output. This was weaker than had been expected in the November Report and Bank staff now expected zero growth in headline GDP in Q4. Business surveys had remained subdued, including the S&P Global UK PMI composite output index, although that had picked up in the flash December release and, more generally, had been above the no-change mark for the past eight months. The steer from business surveys suggested that underlying growth in Q4 would be stronger than headline GDP growth, but at a rate that was still below supply growth. 11: Domestic credit volumes had continued to be supported by reduced policy restriction, along with some improvement in credit supply conditions. The Bank’s latest Credit Conditions Survey had suggested that supply was continuing to improve for households and firms, and firms’ access to bank finance appeared resilient. Nevertheless, credit volumes growth had remained subdued relative to pre-pandemic norms in real terms. Households’ and non-financial corporations’ aggregate balance sheets had also remained resilient, according to the Financial Policy Committee’s latest Financial Stability Report. Alongside this, recent annual growth in broad money had remained in line with the rate seen in 2025 so far, with the ratio of money to nominal GDP remaining below levels implied by its pre-pandemic trend. 12: UK financial conditions were little changed relative to the November MPC meeting. Market pricing implied an expectation for a reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. 13: Global activity indicators had been more resilient than expected at the time of the November Report. This was suggestive of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty not weighing on global economic activity to the extent that had been expected. Alongside this, Chinese export price deflation had increased, following a brief moderation earlier this year. The Autumn Budget 14: The Autumn Budget had taken place on 26 November, accompanied by an economic and fiscal outlook from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Additional fiscal measures had included: spending increases in the short term in the form of reversals to previously announced welfare cuts and the removal of the two-child limit within universal credit. Beyond the short term, these spending increases would be more than offset by future tax increases, primarily from extending the freezes to income tax thresholds out to 2030-31. Smaller contributions would come from increases to National Insurance Contributions on salary-sacrifice pension contributions and increases to property, savings and dividend taxes. 15: Relative to what had been assumed in the November Monetary Policy Report, Bank staff had provisionally estimated that these additional policy measures could increase the level of GDP by around 0.1–0.2% over the next couple of years, with the fiscal tightening through future tax increases weighing on the level of GDP beyond a three-year horizon. 16: The Budget had also included a set of policy measures that had a direct impact on inflation in the short term, which were likely to lower CPI inflation in April by around ½ percentage point. Subsequently, the impact of the direct and indirect effects of Budget policies were expected to push up on CPI inflation by around 0.1–0.2 percentage points in 2027 and 2028. 17: The Committee considered the total fiscal consolidation envisaged in the latest plans for forthcoming years. Cumulatively, fiscal policies announced to date were expected to widen the output gap by around 1 percentage point over the next three years. The Budget had made only a modest additional contribution to this expected widening beyond the next three years. 18: A fuller assessment of this fiscal news would be conducted as part of the February 2026 Monetary Policy Report round. Overview and the Committee’s discussions 19: The Monetary Policy Committee’s job is to ensure that CPI inflation falls all the way back to the 2% target and stays there. Monetary policy had helped to reduce inflationary pressures over the past three years. That had allowed the MPC to make policy less restrictive, by reducing Bank Rate since August 2024. 20: The MPC’s approach to setting Bank Rate outlined in the November Monetary Policy Report had been based on two key policy judgements. First, that underlying domestic wage and price pressures were continuing to ease, and that the risks to medium-term inflation from greater inflation persistence and weaker demand were more balanced. Second, that Bank Rate was likely to continue on a gradual downward path if progress on disinflation continued. 21: Since November, the risk from greater inflation persistence had become somewhat less pronounced, while the risk to medium-term inflation from weaker demand remained. 22: CPI inflation had fallen since the previous meeting, from 3.8% to 3.2%. This was above the 2% target but, following the Budget announcements on administered prices and indirect taxes, headline inflation was now expected to fall back more quickly in April, to closer to 2%. Reflecting restrictive monetary policy, and consistent with evidence of subdued economic growth and building slack in the labour market, pay growth and services price inflation had continued to ease, pointing to further underlying disinflation towards target. Looking forward, however, some indicators of wage and price-setting from the Bank’s Agents and the Decision Maker Panel appeared to have plateaued. 23: Although headline inflation was likely to fall back closer to target in the near term, the Committee would remain focused on ensuring that inflation settled sustainably at 2% in the medium term. The latest data were generally encouraging, but there continued to be risks around that in both directions. 24: The recent experience of high inflation could still be affecting the way wages and prices were being determined in the economy, including owing to structural factors. The hump in inflation earlier this year had not been expected to lead to additional second-round effects in previous central projections. So a faster near-term fall now, owing to similar factors, might be treated in an equivalent way. The Committee would nonetheless monitor carefully the response of still-elevated inflation expectations to recent downside news, including in response to developments in more salient prices such as energy and food. The MPC was also continuing to assess whether and how fast wage and services inflation would fall further towards more target-consistent rates. 25: At the same time, households and businesses could remain cautious about their spending and investment decisions, and the labour market could weaken significantly further. Both of these could lead to inflation falling below target in the medium term. There had been limited news on the demand outlook since the previous meeting. Although GDP growth in 2025 Q4 was likely to be weaker than expected, the flash PMI output index had increased in December. Most labour market data had not suggested a rapid opening up of slack in the economy, even though the unemployment rate had continued to move higher. 26: Different members continued to place different weights on the main risks to inflation. For some of those members who had been more concerned about second-round effects from recent high inflation, the news on near-term inflation from the Budget could lessen these risks to some extent. Nevertheless, other persistence risks remained, particularly in light of the long period of above-target inflation, and the signals from forward-looking indicators were that pay growth could remain elevated next year. For those members who had been less concerned about persistence previously, the remaining upside risks had diminished further, and were now more clearly outweighed by downside risks to demand and the possibility of a more rapid loosening in the labour market. 27: Regarding the second key policy judgement, the extent of further easing in monetary policy still depended on the evolution of the outlook for inflation, and how the evidence on persistence, and on the weakening in demand and the labour market, was playing out. A gradual approach to further easing allowed the Committee to assess carefully the balance of risks to inflation as the evidence evolved. 28: The restrictiveness of monetary policy had fallen as Bank Rate had been progressively reduced. Different members had different views on how, and with what degree of precision, an equilibrium, or neutral, level of Bank Rate could be identified. In the absence of new shocks to the economy, judgements for individual members around further policy easing would become a closer call. This could simply reflect the more limited scope to reduce rates for a given estimate of neutral, or alternatively that the policy approach should recognise the uncertainty around the level of equilibrium rates itself. It could also reflect a high bar for policy reversals, were Bank Rate to be reduced too quickly or by too much, which could undermine credibility. The immediate policy decision 29: The Committee turned to its policy decision at this meeting and the monetary stance required to achieve the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium-term. 30: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points at this meeting. The disinflation process was on track and the key question was how sustainably inflation would settle at the 2% target. Three members in this group (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden and Dave Ramsden) judged that upside risks to inflation had continued to recede, but they would continue to assess incoming evidence, particularly around labour market activity and wage growth. Two members in this group (Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor) attached greater weight to downside risks to activity and inflation. Subdued consumption and rising unemployment were already sufficient to restrain inflation persistence. 31: Four members (Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) preferred to maintain Bank Rate at this meeting, placing greater weight on prolonged inflation persistence, including from structural factors. While acknowledging recent progress on disinflation, the current and forward-looking evidence on services inflation, wage growth and inflation expectations remained above target-consistent levels. This could be symptomatic of more lasting changes in wage and price-setting behaviour. These members were not convinced that the monetary policy stance was meaningfully restrictive. A more prolonged period of policy restriction was warranted to mitigate these upside risks. 32: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.75%. 33: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted in favour of the proposition. Four members (Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted against the proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 4%. MPC members’ views 34: Members set out the rationale underpinning their individual votes on Bank Rate. Members are listed alphabetically under each vote grouping. Votes to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.75% Andrew Bailey: Data news since our latest meeting suggests that disinflation is now more established. CPI inflation has fallen from its recent peak and upside risks have eased. Measures in the Budget should reduce inflation further in the near term. The key question for me now is the extent to which inflation settles at the 2% target in an enduring way. Slack has continued to accumulate in the economy. Unemployment, underemployment and flows from employment to unemployment have all risen. While I do not yet see conclusive evidence of a sharper downturn in the labour market, we should be vigilant. On the other hand, inflation expectations have not yet shifted downward sufficiently following the past few years of persistent above-target inflation. And the strength in forward-looking wage growth indicators is hard to reconcile with the downward momentum in current indicators of inflation and pay as well as rising unemployment. I will continue to assess these risks as the evidence accumulates. While I see scope for some additional policy easing, the path for Bank Rate cannot be pre-judged with precision, recognising in part the more limited space as Bank Rate approaches a neutral level. Sarah Breeden: I judge that disinflation remains on track and that upside risks have diminished a little further since November. Inflation, underlying services inflation, wage growth and households’ inflation expectations have all moved down. Activity data are also consistent with building slack, with a further rise in unemployment and weak employment growth. Previous explanations for why inflation might remain stubbornly above target have become less likely. The Budget has clarified that administered price shocks should not repeat next year. I recognise risks from potential structural changes to the labour market, in particular that matching efficiency may have fallen, and forward‑looking pay surveys are somewhat higher than I would prefer. However, Agents’ reports suggest firms are taking action to contain total wage bills. This, and the weak demand environment, should limit cost pass‑through. Downside risks to the demand outlook remain prominent. As in November, I think it plausible that a structural change in household behaviour means the savings rate remains elevated. Combined with my view that policy remains restrictive and slack continues to build, this gives me enough confidence to cut now. Looking ahead, I will need a greater accumulation of evidence on disinflation as we feel our way towards neutral next year. Swati Dhingra: I see disinflation continuing and risks to activity skewed to the downside. Nominal indicators have been trending consistently in the right direction. Inflationary pressures have faded, with limited pass-through of global food price inflation to consumer prices, and the impact of domestic one-off factors having come through. Disinflation is particularly observable in underlying inflation measures. Moreover, the dynamics of household-led demand weakness, that have contributed to disinflation so far and contained second-round effects, are still very much at play. Weak household spending look set to continue, which should limit firms’ pricing power. The backdrop of a weak labour market is likely to restrain wage growth going forward. Unemployment has risen more rapidly than I expected, given how activity and real wages have evolved, and vacancies remain 10% below pre-pandemic levels. My outlook at this juncture is one of continued weakness in activity. And I am concerned that a protracted period of stagnation could impede supply-side growth. I favour easing policy now, and would not support a drawn-out normalisation of our policy stance given the balance of risks. Dave Ramsden: I view the risks around inflation returning sustainably to target late in 2026 as broadly balanced, which is somewhat earlier than in the November central projection. The disinflation process is on track as nominal indicators continue to normalise. Labour market loosening has anchored this disinflation, and against the backdrop of weak activity and subdued sentiment, a further easing to come should lean against any remaining persistence in wage growth. However, elevated forward-looking surveys of wage growth give me pause for thought, particularly as structural supply-side issues, such as labour market participation, that previously sustained inflation persistence appear to be resolving. I will be focused on the results of the 2026 Agents’ pay survey. I continue to see downside risks from weak demand and particularly consumption. Consistently weak consumer confidence and ongoing fiscal consolidation contribute to a sluggish growth outlook, even if the announcement of the Budget offers some certainty. This outlook supports an easing in monetary policy. Further ahead, as restrictiveness falls and with uncertainty around the neutral rate, there could be scope to slow this cadence of easing in due course. Alan Taylor: Recent developments align with my stated view of the medium-term trajectory: the two key trends are steadily mounting downside risks and inflation firmly on track towards target. The news implies a path for inflation next year that reaches target sooner than in the November central projection. The inflation hump is subsiding a bit earlier: tax and administered price increases drop from annual CPI by April and food inflation is abating faster than expected. High‑frequency CPI indicators, overall and core, are close to target. Wages are on a target‑consistent path, based on incoming settlements data; AWE follows with a lag. Labour market news shows continued loosening. Redundancies are now on the rise and unemployment keeps climbing, markedly so among cyclically-sensitive younger cohorts. Demand is subdued, with surveys signalling weak output, deteriorating investment intentions, and low consumer confidence. Company dissolutions are increasing. These worrying trends point to the risk of at least a costly undershoot on inflation, if not a sharper non-linear deterioration in activity and the labour market, should we brake too hard. I see neutral at about 3%. Given transmission lags, and with inflation expected near target by late 2026, we should be heading there sooner rather than later. Votes to maintain Bank Rate at 4% Megan Greene: I think risks to inflation have shifted to the downside since November. I put weight on threshold effects and the salience of food and energy prices in the inflation basket. The budget will mechanically reduce inflation below thresholds that feed into expectations largely because of lower energy prices. Recent food price and CPI price inflation surprised on the downside as well. This should reduce the risk of elevated inflation expectations generating second-round effects, but I remain concerned the disinflation process has slowed and may stall further. Forward‑looking indicators of wage growth from the Agents and Decision Maker Panel remain above target-consistent levels. This could buoy services inflation, while core goods inflation remains above pre-Covid averages. Financial and credit conditions are relatively easy, suggesting the monetary policy stance is not meaningfully restrictive. Labour market slack is rising and, while rising redundancies are a concern, there is little evidence a non-linear rise in unemployment is imminent. Labour market adjustments may also be buffered by resilient corporate balance sheets and loose credit conditions. As Bank Rate approaches neutral, the contribution of monetary policy versus structural factors to disinflation could become harder to discern. This warrants a more cautious cadence of easing. Clare Lombardelli: I continue to be more concerned by the upside risks to inflation, despite growth and inflation data since November having softened at the margin. The Budget should mechanically reduce annual inflation in salient categories, reducing the risk of second-round effects, but in absolute terms underlying inflation is still well above target-consistent rates. Disinflation in wage growth will be crucial in returning inflation sustainably to target, yet forward-looking indicators of wage growth from the DMP and Agents suggest little disinflation in wages over the next year. Elevated wage growth contrasts with softening labour market quantities. This could indicate structural issues in the economy which would sustain greater inflation persistence than embodied in the November central projection. I am also uncertain about the amount of restriction that our current policy stance is imparting, where signals across the data are mixed, and future policy reversal could be costly for policy credibility. This calls for retaining policy restriction and, all else equal, could require slowing the pace of future policy easing. Catherine L Mann: My decision was quite finely balanced, and made more challenging by the effect of various policies on wage and price dynamics. Two key judgements underpin my decision. First, despite the Budget’s expected mechanical reduction in near-term inflation, this may not be enough to rein-in elevated household inflation expectations that have formed during a prolonged high‑inflation environment. CPI inflation remains above target, services inflation remains high relative to international peers, and core goods inflation is well above historical target‑consistent rates. Second, despite soft private-sector activity, this has not yet sufficiently disciplined wage and price growth. Market sector output is indisputably soft, private employment is falling, and redundancies and business dissolutions are rising. I am particularly attentive to the possibility that these could be signs of a non-linear adjustment. Counterbalancing these data, forward‑looking wage measures are above target‑consistent ranges, government spending and employment has risen, and any potential fiscal overspend could reduce slack, as has been the case in the past. In light of these risks, and given that restrictiveness in financial conditions has already eased over the year, policy needs to remain restrictive for some time longer. Huw Pill: I continue to judge the risk of inflation stabilising at above-target levels owing to structural changes in price and wage-setting behaviour as greater than the risk of inflation undershooting the target owing to weak demand. Underlying inflationary pressures are stronger than expected a year ago. A number of key indicators of underlying inflationary momentum – such as one-year ahead own price and wage expectations in the Decision Maker Panel, and households’ medium-term inflation expectations – exhibit a shallow saucer-shaped profile, raising concerns about a slowing or stalling in disinflation towards target. While I am attentive to risks from weak demand, still resilient private‑sector balance sheets provide some reassurance against a sharp downturn owing to a corporate cash-flow squeeze. Given this balance of risks, the case for the further withdrawal of monetary policy restriction is becoming more finely balanced, and any additional steps in this direction should be cautious.
